<p>During Bowling CCA sessions, we usually train physically with all of our bowling equipment at a bowling alley. It is a place where we can foster bonds with our teammates, build our character and improve our bowling skills as a team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the drastic changes in our training regimes, like having to train at home alone during virtual CCA sessions, and not being able to use our actual bowling equipment but instead with rubber balls that weigh much less, all of us have consistently attended training sessions online and still do our best during these Zoom calls without fail. By having these Zoom calls and practising at home, we kept our momentum and sharpened our technique so that we are ready to go back to the lanes and play competitively. It was hard getting everyone to be less shy and turn on their cameras, but by setting examples for one another, we became more familiar with Zoom and got used to it. On top of that, our coach was able to teach in depth the theory about bowling which some of us never knew before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March, there was NSG B Div Competition for the Sec 3 and 4 players. We managed to train at the bowling lanes a few times before the actual competition. Although we did not manage to win, the whole team did their best, silently comforting each other when we were down and cheering for each other without any physical contact. It was very heart-warming to feel the team spirit despite the SMM measures, and it was definitely an unforgettable experience for us all.&nbsp;</p>
