<p>Badminton is a sport that demands good fitness and mental strength. A badminton playerâ€™s speed, stamina, agility, and strength as well mental strength is crucial and it is put to the test on court. A lot of patience, determination as well as perseverance is needed in order to be able to master the sport. Training is often strenuous but enriching as it allows us to be able to perfect our current skills. The strenuous training allowed us to bond as a team, help each other out to brush up on our individual skills and learn the importance of teamwork which we can use to achieve our goals as a team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic this year, face to face CCA was put on hold for a few months and e-CCA was introduced instead. This deprived us of the chance to bond as a team, especially to get to know the new Sec 1. Since e-CCA was relatively new to most of us, some of us struggled to adapt to the training plan that was being conducted. However, we persevered through the months of e-CCA and found out that most of our skillset, physical fitness level had improved! Online bonding sessions - such as playing engaging online games, were also conducted to help us stay united as a team in spite of the ongoing pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the pandemic, the B-division girls were very fortunate to be able to participate in the National School Games (NSG). We were very elated and delighted as we were finally able to take part in the competition after the games were suspended last year. We were also able to put our skills to the test in the school games after the intense and tireless training over the past months. After the intense matches, the B division achieved 4th place in the east zone competition! Sadly, the C division was not able to take part in the National School Games (NSG) this year as it was cancelled. Many of them were disappointed as they had trained vigorously in preparation for the tournament. However, most of them still maintain a positive outlook and continue to train hard for the competition next year.</p>
<p>Overall, not only has badminton taught us the importance of physical and mental toughness, it has also emphasized the significance of a bonded team as well as team spirit. Although the pandemic had indeed brought some difficulties to us, it gave us the opportunity to learn to overcome challenges as a team during this period of time.</p>
