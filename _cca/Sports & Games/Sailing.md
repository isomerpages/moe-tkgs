<p>In Sailing, there are many uncontrollable factors that are constantly changing such as weather conditions and wind shifts. Despite these challenges we continue to train hard every week to do better and strive to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the TKGS sailors many challenges. For the second year in a row, we were unable to compete in the regattas (competitions) and more importantly, the National School Games. Due to Safe Management Measures (SMM), we have shifted the majority of our CCA trainings through Zoom performing physical trainings. Although it is not be the most ideal way to train, we still make use of the opportunity to bond with our team mates, albeit virtually, and at the same time maintain our fitness levels. We look forward to 2022 to which we hope to achieve great things to bring honour to our school.<table>
