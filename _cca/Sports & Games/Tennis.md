<p>Tennis, a sport that challenges a personâ€™s physical and mental strength. But at the same time, it teaches us important values such as discipline, respect and determination. Through our tennis CCA, we have learnt the values of humility and graciousness in times of glory and setbacks.</p>
<p>This year started with uncertainty due to COVID-19. We were unsure whether the B Division competition would be happening. However, we remained positive and determined as a team. We continued to attend constant training to prepare ourselves for the competition. During the competition, our players put in all of their efforts to make our school proud. Through the screams and tears, we persevered despite all the setbacks. Through competition, we bonded with our fellow teammates and kept the team spirit strong. Even though we did not get the results we wanted, we had no regrets and were grateful for the opportunity that was given.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the COVID situation got worse, we had to conduct e-CCA instead. Although it was hard to conduct a sports CCA online, the members cooperated with the leaders. In the end, e-CCA was a success. Even though we were not able to play tennis, the leaders incorporated tennis videos and bonding games. Such as Kahoot and other games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through all hardships we faced, we stayed strong and continued keeping up our team spirit. This could not have been done without the help of our coaches and teachers that guided us. On behalf of the team, we would like to thank them for their patience and guidance. Our members will continue to strive and work hard for our school. We will remain resilient in the face of challenges.</p>
