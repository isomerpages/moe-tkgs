<p>TKGS Softball took in its first team of players in the early 1990s. As it is a sport that is both mentally and physically demanding, it has led to challenges during training. However, with the guidance of our coaches and encouragement from our peers, we were able to overcome them. Through our time in TKGS Softball, we hope to cultivate values such as discipline, resilience and respect. As softball training is rigorous, it also helps us to sharpen our time management skills as we learn to balance our CCA training with our academic performances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the games and training, we were also able to understand the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship. Some of these games that strengthen our team bonding would be our relay races and our annual overnight camp. This allows interaction between all levels, while also allowing us to identify each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses which is a key factor in all team sports. As the saying goes, &ldquo;no man is an island&rdquo;, and working with other people will help build camaraderie in the team. We also learnt to depend on one another instead of just relying on our own limited strength.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the challenges the team faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic and Safe Management Measures (SMM) put in place was that the team was unable to train together. It was difficult for the team to maintain a close bond especially between different levels. Therefore, we moved our training sessions online. With the help of our coach and teachers-in-charge, the team was able to benefit during the virtual training sessions as we held team bonding and physical training sessions. After the SMM was slightly lifted, field training resumed and we managed to have fun as a team. We kept the spirit high by teaching the juniors softball cheers, playing games, and having our own individual competitions.</p>
<p>This Covid-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of being diligent and mentally resilient as we adapt to the challenges we might face in the future.</p>
