<p>The TKGS Netball team is a group of passionate and driven sportswomen, who believe in resilience and teamwork. We aim to excel in both our academic and sporting life, while maintaining our physical and mental health. We have close friendships with both our teammates and coach, which strengthens the team's unity. We constantly work towards consistency, and will always reflect after setbacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started the year with the hopes of competing in the NSG, building on the legacy our seniors build in 2019. However, to our disappointment, netball is not part of the sports allowed for NSG this year. Nonetheless, we continued with our training with the aim of sharpening our skills so that we will be ready once we are allowed to compete. We also had a 2-day camp in March where we welcomed the new secondary 1 netballers. We also attended a mental resilience workshop during the camp, where Charmaine Soh, the captain of the Singapore national team shared her training experience during this pandemic. This inspired us to keep going. To close the camp, we had a farewell for our secondary 4 seniors.</p>
<p>This year, we learned to be more adaptable and flexible when faced with uncertainties. As a CCA, we had to shift from physical training to zoom session whenever the Covid situation becomes worse. As individual, we learned to be more disciplined and to have the mental resilience to push ourselves. As we maintain our social distance from one another, we must not forget that netball is a team sport and we need to keep our team spirit high. In 2022, we hope to be able to reach greater heights in NSG and the various Netball carnivals, should the current situation permit.</p>
