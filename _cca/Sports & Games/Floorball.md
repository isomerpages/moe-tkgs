<p>Our Floorball teams are defined by their competitive drive and unity. In recent years, they have secured their place among the top schools in the National School Games, a result of their relentless effort and commitment to training rather than talent alone.

However, our focus goes beyond match results. We teach our players to stay composed under pressure and view difficulties as necessary steps for development. They have learned that true growth comes from facing obstacles head-on and adapting when things get tough.

Looking ahead, we aim to push our boundaries even further. We remain dedicated to surpassing our previous bests, fostering a culture where players fight for every ball and support one another until the final whistle.</p>
