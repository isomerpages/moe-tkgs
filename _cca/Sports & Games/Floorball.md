<p>In 2021, the Floorball CCA welcomed ten Secondary 1 pupils, five of whom were DSA students. Everyone was ecstatic to greet the juniors. Secondary 2 students organized a variety of unforgettable team-bonding activities for the Secondary Ones during their first CCA session. The juniors quickly developed a rapport with their seniors. Throughout the year, even though CCA sessions were not regular due to COVID-19, the Secondary Ones were able to train extensively on their own. The Secondary 2 players, on the other hand, provided continual instruction to their juniors on how to conduct effective self-directed training sessions and also how to maintain self-discipline during self-training sessions.</p>
<p>Similar to 2020, 2021 was a year that denied us numerous opportunities to participate in various Floorball competitions. Despite that, we managed to maintain a positive attitude throughout the year. We chose to train as hard as we would during Pre-COVID19 times. We also proactively choose to maintain strong team relationships despite the lack of face-to-face interaction by having regular team-bonding sessions with everyone.</p>
<p>We look forward to 2022, which we are positive will be a more fruitful year for all of us.</p>
