<p>Established in 1998 by Ms. Chua Siew Ling, the String Ensemble has grown steadily, from a very modest 10-member team to the current 40-strong ensemble.</p>

<p>The ensemble has participated regularly in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), clinching gold and silver awards. Most recently, the string ensemble was awarded the highest accolade, the Certificate of Distinction for the past five SYF Arts Presentation in 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2023. The ensemble is currently under the baton of Mr. Jesher Loi, and has put up a successful concert, Sounds of Irisdescence, in collaboration with the TKGS Symphonic Band at the SotA Concert Hall.</p>
<p>Dedicated to providing our young musicians with musical, social and intellectual growth, the string ensemble has nurtured many music enthusiasts and young talents and will continue to do so for years to come.</p>
