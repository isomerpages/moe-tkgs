<p>Under the direction of Ms. Lim Ai Hooi, the Choir has garnered numerous prestigious awards and distinctions, both locally and internationally.  Since 2009, it has maintained a remarkable track record of excellence, attaining top honours such as Gold with Honours and the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. Additionally, on the global stage, the Choir secured a prestigious Gold Award in the Open Category at the 7th Winter Choral Festival (2016) held in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>The TKGS Choir offers a plethora of opportunities for individuals to hone their skills as singers and performers through participation in various school and public events. Some highlights include performances at the Esplanade Concert Hall under ‘Limelight’ series (2017 and 2019), performance at Hwa Chong Institution in 2023 and our in-house production ‘Unity Through Colours’ on 5th April 2024. </p>
<p>Choral workshops are also frequently organised to enrich the learning experiences of our choristers. Renowned maestros such as Mr. Andre van der Merwe from South Africa (2016 &amp; 2023) and Dr T J Harper from the United States (2024) have led some of these workshops. Additionally, choral exchanges with schools, such as St Nicholas’ Girls’ School and Nanyang Girls’ High School have provided valuable opportunities for our choristers to broaden their horizons and understanding of diverse repertoires. </p>
<p>Guided by the motto "A Vibrant and United Choir," the Choir places a strong emphasis on character development and strives to reach greater heights by nurturing each chorister's journey toward choral excellence. </p>
