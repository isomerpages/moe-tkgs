<p>Under the baton of Ms Lim Ai Hooi, the Choir has obtained several notable awards and achievements both locally and internationally. It was awarded the highest accolade, Gold with Honours and the Certificate of Distinction, at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation since 2009. Most recently, we clinched a Gold Award in the Open Category at in the 7th Winter Choral Festival (2016) in Hong Kong and a Distinction in SYF 2019, and performed at Esplanade for its Limelight programme, 2019.</p>
<p>The TKGS Choir offers many different opportunities for one to grow as a singer and performer through school and public events. Some of such recent events include performances at the Esplanade Concert Hall (2017 and 2019), Christmas carolling at Gardens by the Bay (2016) and performance at the launch of the 2nd edition of Singapore Rhapsodies (2017) in the beautiful backdrop of the National Museum of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choral workshops and exchanges are also frequently organised to enrich the learning of our choristers. Some of these past workshops were conducted by world renowned maestros such as Mr Andre van der Merwe from South Africa (2016), Dr Eugene Rogers from the United States (2017) and Ms Maria Guinand from Venezuela (2019). The various choral exchanges, such as that with Diocesan Girls' School from Hong Kong (2016), Inggou Victory Choir from Indonesia (2017) and with various local schools allowed our choristers to exchange their choir experiences with their counterparts and raise their awareness in the diverse vocal technique and repertoire. The Show Choir workshop (2015), on the other hand, gave our choristers a different take on the traditional choral scene.</p>
<p>Guided by the Choir's motto, "A Vibrant and United Choir", the Choir emphasizes character building and seeks to continue to scale greater heights by empowering every chorister through the pursuit of choral excellence. We warmly welcome anyone with a passion for singing and a desire to learn.</p>
