<p>The TKGS Dance Club (Modern), established in 2004, includes both Ballet and Modern dance groups. Members train weekly, learning from and with each other, and have the opportunity to explore various dance styles and participate in numerous school and public performances. After four years in the TKGS Dance Club, dancers develop strong psychomotor skills, a diverse repertoire of dance techniques, and significant leadership and organizational abilities.</p> 

<p>Since 2009, the TKGS Dancers have consistently excelled at the Singapore Youth Festival, showcasing exceptional performance standards and artistry. They maintain a busy schedule with regular performances at the school's Speech Day and anniversary celebrations, and in 2024, they were invited to perform by organizations such as Sengkang General Hospital Community Hearts and Our Tampines Hub.</p>

<p>Additionally, some dancers have participated in the AMPLIFIED!Dancelab22: A Youth Leadership Dance Event, organized by the MOE’s Arts Education Branch in collaboration with Lasalle College of the Arts. This event provides dancers with hands-on experience in dance production and stage management. </p>
