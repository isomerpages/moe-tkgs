<p>TK Thespians (Drama) are a vibrant community of creative and talented students who are passionate about the dramatic arts. Members attend weekly training sessions and workshops conducted by experienced and qualified drama teachers and instructor to develop their acting skills and the use of voice, movement and improvisation techniques.</p>
<p>School performances and participation in drama competitions also provide members with many opportunities to develop basic technical expertise in aspects of a production design such as lighting, sound, props, set, costume, hair and make-up. There are also many platforms for student-initiated performances where budding scriptwriters and directors get to devise, direct and stage their own work. They also get a good exposure to a wide variety of performance genres and styles through learning journeys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TK Thespians participated in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentations (AP) and attained the Certificate of Distinction for all their performances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is always great learning experience for students who demonstrate leadership and responsibility in the production of their short skits, with assistance and guidance from their Drama teachers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016 and 2018, TK Thespians prepared and sold tickets for their very own performance outside school. 2018&rsquo;s performance was part of a combined concert, Stage V, with the school&rsquo;s Dance Club at the Victoria Theatre, where students put up a short play that they had a part in writing and directing. 2016&rsquo;s performance was a play performed at the Goodman Arts Centre&rsquo;s Blackbox. TK Thespians also wrote their own script and helped to direct the performance.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Drama Club scored a Certificate of Distinction for their stage play titled &lsquo;Edit&rdquo;. The stage performance was praised by all, for its innovative theme based on society&rsquo;s addiction to social media and &lsquo;likes&rsquo;. Coupled with a beautiful storyline and an underlying message of character versus popularity, it became an instant hit with the audience.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Drama Club participated in M1Peer Pleasure (M1PP) Youth Theatre Festival 2020, with a staged reading of the play titled "If These Wheels Could Speak".</p>
<p>This event was themed Youth Theatre with a Social Conscience and the Drama Club girls did justice to the theme with their extensive research and interviews with people with disabilities. There was a conscious effort to understand the social issue and promote support for people with special needs. The girls helped devise a compelling script with guidance from the Drama instructors and script writers.</p>
<p>"If These Wheels Could Speak&rdquo; was broadcast as a Facebook Live show and there were post-show dialogues too. This performance was a joint effort with M1PP, and was initially meant to be a stage show at the Esplanade Theatre. The plan was later changed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The club showed adaptability and flexibility in the face of changing situations while ensuring that their hard work culminated in a worthwhile showcase of talent.</p>
<p>The recorded staged reading was later screened to the whole school during an assembly period, and was well received by the students.</p>
<p>2021 shall be another exciting year as the Thespians prepare for the 2021 SYF AP, participate in more performances, and continue to serve the community!</p>
