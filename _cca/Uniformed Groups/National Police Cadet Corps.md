<p>2023 is another fun-filled year for our committed members of TKGS NPCC. Our cadets continue to earn their proficiency badges for the past months and participated in many activities.  For 2024, our Sec 4 cadets organized a 1.5-day of non-residential Unit Bonding Camp on 11 March 2024 to build a greater sense of belonging in the cadets.  The camp featured various activities designed to strengthen bonds and help the cadets get to know each other better. We also ventured out further to Rifle Range Park for the annual Unit Hike.  In addition, we also organised outreach programme with our Sec 2 and 3 cadets sharing scam prevention tips via a card game with the school community and our Annual Area Games Day. This year brought special recognition to our cadet leaders. Three of our cadet leaders were awarded the prestigious SPF-NPCC badge which recognizes outstanding cadets with outstanding leadership qualities.  Our Sec 4 cadet leader from 2024 SI (NPCC), Audrey Lee and SI(NPCC) Simran Alexander, were also awarded the rank of Station Inspector (SI), the highest rank a cadet can achieve in their four years in NPCC. </p>
