<p>Girl Guides provides opportunities for girls to discover and develop our strengths, skills and pushes us to our fullest potential into becoming responsible citizens of the world. With our motto being "Be Prepared", our activities are designed to prepare us to handle new or unexpected situations and challenges with a sense of confidence and self-assuredness. It also builds and strengthens our leadership skills by allowing us to take the lead in Company and Patrol activities, from learning to organise events, teaching each other new skills, to participating in national events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, we participated in the annual East Division Day and won silver in Comic Strip Making as well as merit in Patch Design. We also participated in various other events such as East Division Learning Day, Plogathon, World Thinking Day and the PUB Water Challenge. When Covid-19 struck, we were hard-hit as most of our sessions involved face-to-face physical activities. However, we have learnt to adapt to such situations. For example, we participate in an annual overnight March Camp, where we put our Guiding skills into activities planned throughout the camp. However, this year, we had to cut the camp short by omitting the overnight stay. Nevertheless, we still had lots of fun as we carried out fun activities such as Water Games, Outdoor Cooking, Gadget-Making, and more. We also found ourselves having to carry out e-CCA as the Covid-19 situation worsened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although challenging, we were able to find ways to engage our members by incorporating innovative online materials for them to use while keeping to the objectives of our session!&nbsp;</p>
