<p>Girl Guides provides opportunities for our girls to discover and develop their strengths and skills while guiding them to fulfil their fullest potential into becoming responsible citizens of the world. With our motto being "Be Prepared", activities are designed to prepare our girls to handle new or unexpected situations and challenges with a sense of confidence and self-assuredness. Girl Guides also builds and strengthens our girls’ leadership skills by empowering them to take the lead in Company and Patrol activities. From organising educational events and teaching their fellow guides outdoor skills, to participating in national events, our girls gain valuable leadership experience and teamwork skills. Below are testimonials from our guides, illustrating the impact of the Girl Guides program: </p>

<p>"For World Thinking Day, I had the privilege to be part of the main contingent and marched in front of the whole school. I felt proud to be a guide as the whole school saw us in our uniform <b>as we showcased our</b> contributions to society.”<b> – D Ummekulsum (3S5) </b> </p>

<p>I learnt that I am independent in my overnight stay away from my home during the March camp. It helped that I am comfortable being with all my fellow guides. There were also leadership opportunities for me during the camp as I led the sec 1s in gadget-making. The campfire night and water games were memorable as I was able to bond with my patrol mates. Overall, I really enjoyed the camp and I’m looking forward to the next one already!” – <b>SAMRAH SAMMIL, 2 Resilience</b></p>

<p>“Girl Guides provides a supportive environment where we can connect with one another. Such moments bring us immense joy and comfort. I am thankful for the constant support from my fellow guides - my seniors mentor and look after me, my peers encourage me, and my juniors bring laughter to our gatherings.” – <b>SOPHIA ADRIANA TNG BINTE ROHAIZAD, 3 Compassion</b></p>
