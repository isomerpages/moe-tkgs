<p>Girl Guides provides opportunities for girls to discover and develop our strengths, skills and pushes us to our fullest potential into becoming responsible citizens of the world. With our motto being "Be Prepared", our activities are designed to prepare us to handle new or unexpected situations and challenges with a sense of confidence and self-assuredness. It also builds and strengthens our leadership skills by allowing us to take the lead in Company and Patrol activities, from learning to organise events, teaching each other new skills, to participating in national events.</p>
