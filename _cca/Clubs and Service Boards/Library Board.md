<p dir="ltr">The Library Board aims to promote the love for reading and writing and provides members with various opportunities to participate in competitions to hone their writing and information literacy skills. We forge close bonds with one another by sharing our love for books and reading.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We started off 2021 with the Secondary One Orientation cum Bonding, followed by a sharing of a video created by the Secondary Ones on books by local author Gabby Tye. To better appreciate Singapore Literature, librarians attended a virtual workshop by renowned local writer, Alvin Pang. We also created thematic displays on Singapore Literature, shape poems by our Secondary Ones and posters on friendship.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;A group of Secondary Two librarians participated in the NLB &lsquo;Prove It!&rsquo; Competition, where they learnt information literacy skills. They had to create a video about the S.U.R.E. (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate) steps and used it as part of their advocacy efforts to promote information literacy to their schoolmates.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Four Lower Secondary librarians also joined the Historical Scene Investigation Challenge 2021, where they learnt how to do research on Singapore history and to produce a video and write up to present their findings.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A few Secondary Three librarians participated in the Science Chronicles 2021, a science fiction writing competition organized by the Science Centre, where we were tasked to write an essay with the topic &lsquo;Reimagine our World&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We also held a virtual farewell and bonding over Zoom for our Secondary Four librarians.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An interesting virtual learning journey we attended was Man vs Nature by NLB, where we virtually explored a set of exhibits in the National Library about Singapore&rsquo;s natural history. The exhibition was fun and interactive, and we learnt a lot about the various flora and fauna in Singapore many years ago.</p>
