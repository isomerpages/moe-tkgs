<p>The Literary Arts Club is a vibrant community where language, ideas and literacy come together. The club provides students with diverse platforms to express themselves, think critically and serve the community meaningfully.</p>

<p>Members with a passion for writing and speaking hone their craft through regular writing workshops, presentation sessions and public speaking opportunities. Students engage with current issues, explore creative expression, and participate in competitions such as the National Public Speaking Competition, Singapore Secondary School Debating Competition (SSSDC) as well as competitions organised by National Library Board (NLB). Through participation in the NLB Prove It! Contest and NLB Historical Scene Investigation (H.S.I.) Challenge, students acquire skills such as research, information literacy, report writing and video making.</p>

<p>Serving the school community, club members aim to cultivate a strong reading culture through book sharing sessions during morning assembly. They contribute to resource acquisition by reviewing books and create publicity materials using digital tools. Through community programmes such as NLB KidsREAD, members serve as reading mentors to younger children, developing empathy and leadership. </p>

<p>Together, the club nurtures confident communicators, thoughtful readers and socially responsible learners.</p>
