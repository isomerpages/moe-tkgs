<p>A heart filled with thankfulness!</p>
<p>This is how we concluded 2023 and welcome 2024.</p>
<p>In 2023, we received a very strong affirmation from the students through the Quality of School Experience survey conducted by MOE. Across the key student processes such as Learning and Social Processes, as well as Cognitive and Social Well-being, students responded positively. More specifically, in the areas of Holistic Student Development, Engagement of Learning, Growth Mindset, Teacher-Student Relationship and Peer Relationship, the school has improved compared to 2021 and did better than the national cohort. We are greatly heartened to see a high 91% of students attesting to the sense of belonging to the school.</p>

<p>It is with the same heart of thankfulness that we welcome 2024. </p>

<p>This year TKGS continues to have a very encouraging Sec 1 enrolment with a high 89.9% of the 2024 Sec 1 cohort choosing TKGS as their top 3 choices. Good news indeed! We are very thankful for each and every girl who has made TKGS her choice school and her second home. </p>

<p>2024 marks a significant milestone in the history of TKGS as we embark on Full Subject-based Banding and welcome our first batch of G3 and G2 students. In the spirit of embracing all learners as espoused in the school song, we consider it a privileged opportunity to extend the TKGS brand of education to a wider and more diverse group of learners. </p>
	
<p>It is a TKGS tradition to welcome the new school year with a Year Theme jointly conceptualised by the Prefectorial Board Executive Committee and the School Principal.</p>
<p>I am proud to present the Year Theme for 2024: </p>

Here, I would like to share the thinking behind the Year Theme so that you may be encouraged by the depth of thought the Prefectorial Board EXCO led by Head Prefect,<br>
Loi Si Ling, put in to conceptualise the Year Theme. 

<strong>Year Theme for 2024</strong>
<br>The Year Theme, Luceat Omnibus, is based on 2 distinct concepts – Courage and Light.
<br><br><u>Courage as represented by the Lion</u><br>
As we start a new school year, we enter a new season of learning and growth. There may be uncertainties and the unknowns, but the TKGians will be strong and courageous. We dare to try, because we each have unique strengths to bring to every situation and challenge, and when we pull together our collective strength, we will find a courage that is greater than our individual selves. Stronger together, bolder together.
<p>We hope that the 2024 Year Theme would encourage TKGians to not fear failure or setbacks. We shall not let the fear of failure inhibit us from aspiring towards greater things. We want to take courage, face up to our fears and push ourselves beyond what we perceive as our limitations. As an inquisitive learner, the TKGian must be brave to learn, unlearn and relearn in the pursuit of growth and excellence. That’s how we will reach our fullest potential. </p>
<p>Hence the symbol of the lion to inspire a courageous lion spirit in each and every TKGian.</p>

<u>Light as represented by the Sun</u><br>
TKGS is a school that radiates positive energy and collective vibrancy, while enabling every student to be their own person and find their own sparkle. Here in TKGS, we see every TKGian for the person she is – with her unique personality, strengths, talents, interests, abilities and potential, be it in the academics, CCA or beyond. 
<p>Our encouragement to all TKGians is for every girl to find her own light. 
To the TKGians, your light is something that only you know how it sparkles, and only you can ignite. Everyone is capable of creating your own Sparkling Moments. So let your light shine! It is when we let the light in each and every one of us shine through that we are able to continuously create the TKGS Sparkling Moments as a school. Collectively, TKGS can then shine our light to impact many others beyond the school, in the community. </p>
<p>The sun is used to symbolise positivity in everything. The light rays emitted from the bright sun represents the way for TKGians, directing them onto the right path. 
The sun also represents the TKGS family - our friends, teachers and parents. As sunlight is essential for a tree to photosynthesize and grow, it is similar to how help from our trusted teachers, friends and parents, is necessary for the growth of the TKGians. Only with the radiant sun will the mighty oak tree grow bigger and stronger.</p>

<u>The TKGian as a Mighty Oak</u><br>
The magnificent Oak Tree symbolises a growing TKGian – strong, firmly anchored, and flourishing. The oak tree is also found in the TKGS Student Development Framework that guides the teachers.  The school believes that when the good seeds which represent our school values, good soil and strong roots come together, it provides a caring, affirming and enabling environment for TKGians to thrive and flourish like mighty oaks.
<p>The oak tree in the Year Theme serves to remind TKGians to be strong and resilient to take on challenges that come our way, and stay deeply rooted in the school culture.  </p>

The 2024 Year Theme therefore empowers everyone to be courageous and go beyond their limits to achieve greater things in 2024 and beyond. We wish everyone a great year ahead, for 2024 will be a year of abundant growth and positivity for all. <br><br>
Let your light shine and shine for all, Luceat Omnibus!

Yours sincerely, <br>
