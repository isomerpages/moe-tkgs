<p>Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) 2026 is now open. </p>

<p>Parents who would like to know more about MOE FAS and eligibility can visit: <br> <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance</a>.</p>

<h4>Income eligibility criteria</h4>
Monthly gross household income (GHI) ≤$4,000, or a monthly per capita income (PCI) ≤$1,000.

<h4>Application Procedure</h4>
<li>Application is open throughout the year.</li>
<li>To make application more convenient, MOE has onboarded Household Means Eligibility System (HOMES) for means-testing of financial assistance from the 2026 application cycle onwards. This streamlines the process as most parents will no longer need to submit supporting documents.</li>
<li>If you have children in different government or government-aided schools, you just need to submit 1 application form to any of their schools.</li>
<li>Apply for MOE FAS via <a href="https://form.gov.sg/68b7e92465cd36be287889c6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eFAS</a>, or through the ‘Services’ tab in Parents Gateway, or approach the school directly with a hardcopy application form. Online submission is strongly encouraged.</li>
<li>Students who are ComCare beneficiaries will be automatically granted MOE FAS for 2026. There is no requirement for this group of students to apply for MOE FAS.</li>

<h4>Supporting Documents</h4>

<li>For application via eFAS, there is no need to prepare any income supporting documents if you and your household members only have employment and/or trade income and do not have other administrative income which are taxable (e.g. rental income, dividends and taxable investment income etc).</li>

<li>For hardcopy applications, all compulsory documents must be submitted together with the completed application <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/financial-matters/moe-fas.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">form</a></li>

<li>The school may request additional documents as required for verification purposes.</li>
