<p>2024 was a bright sparkling year for us as it was a season of courageous endeavours and a season of great harvests. We invite you to delve into the pages of our <a href="https://online.fliphtml5.com/imxpa/llbw/#p=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 Yearbook</a> to find out more about why this year was so special for us. </p>

<p>Hearts filled with thankfulness, we therefore welcome 2025 with a renewed sense of hope and optimism!</p>

<p>Starting the year on a high is the very encouraging Sec 1 enrolment with an impressive 99% of the 2025 Sec 1 cohort choosing TKGS as their top 3 choices. The school’s cut-off points have also improved. Good news indeed! The <a href="https://go.gov.sg/tkgs-eprospectus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TKGS brand of education</a> remains strong. We are very thankful for each and every girl who has made TKGS her choice school and her second home.</p>

<p>As we take the leap of faith into 2025, we shall have a clear sense of who we are as a school and stay purpose-driven, mission-focused. Strengthening our core, we will continue to foster quality relationships at all levels to create a strong sense of community and make TKGS an inviting place for students and staff. The positive, caring and vibrant school culture is distinctive, well-anchored on values, sisterhood and a big heart to embrace all learners. In 2025, as we seek to build on and build up, we will also challenge ourselves to be bold and imaginative so that TKGS will grow from strength to strength, yielding harvests after harvests.</p>

<p>It is a TKGS tradition to welcome the new school year with a Year Theme jointly conceptualised by the Prefectorial Board Executive Committee and the School Principal.</p>

<p>I am proud to present the Year Theme for 2025:</p>

<p>Here, I would like to share the thinking behind the Year Theme so that you may be encouraged by the depth of thought the Prefectorial Board EXCO led by Head Prefect, Olivia Lu, put in to conceptualise the Year Theme.</p>

<p><b>Year Theme for 2025</b><br>
The Year Theme, Aurora Odyssey, is based on 3 big ideas – Discovery, Hope and Determination.</p>

<p><u>Discovery</u><br>
In today's world, we live in a digital era where information is at the tip of our fingers. We have become so accustomed to having our answers given to us that the precious journey of being an “inquisitive learner” is perhaps lost. Thus, with this year’s theme, we want to bring all of us on the journey of exploring new experiences and conquering the unknown. For what is familiar, let us look with a new sense of wonderment. Immerse ourselves in new experiences, and be bold in imagining possibilities.</p>

<p><u>Hope</u><br>
To have hope means to have the yearning of making new discoveries and experience the wonder of stepping into new possibilities. We wish for everyone to have a confident expectation of the good and greater things to come.</p>

<p><u>Determination</u><br>
Determination is needed on any adventure. As exhilarating as it may be, every adventure comes with obstacles, setbacks and detours. We need determination to overcome the obstacles, to rebound from setbacks and to stay on course to reach the destination. We believe that regardless of the challenges, each of us will have the strength to rise above and transform any negativity into a positive force.</p>

<p>The 3 concepts of Discovery, Hope and Determination are represented by the following symbols in the artistic design of the year theme: </p>

<p><u>The Galaxy</u><br>
The galaxy symbolises our connection to the larger cosmos. As a TKGian, our individual journey is part of a larger whole as a class, as a CCA and as a school. As a school, we are part of a bigger purpose, part of a greater good. The galaxy also represents the uncharted territories that we have yet to explore, the endless possibilities awaiting us and the many aspirations that we can fulfil this year. </p>

<p><u>TKGS Spaceship</u><br>
TKGS spaceship symbolises the spirit of adventure and innovation. It invites us to be bold in venturing into the unknown and also to imagine possibilities. When we take the leap of faith, we achieve breakthroughs – personal breakthroughs and breakthroughs as a school. The TKGS crest on the spaceship calls to the sense of sisterhood as we embark upon this brave adventure together.</p>

<p><u>The North Star</u><br>
Symbolising hope and inspiration is the North Star, which is a sky marker that helps whoever follows it find direction. Therefore the star in the year theme symbolises the guiding light that keeps us on the right path.  We can hold onto hope and bravely embrace new challenges because of the various pillars of strength we can rely on in school, may it be friends or teachers. In the past, the North Star was the only way for some sailors to go back home. Similarly in school, we will always have someone to count on in this journey. May we all find our True North!

</p><p>Through the 2025 year theme, we hope that everyone is encouraged to be curious and bold. Cast our vision into the galaxy of possibilities and embrace the exhilarating joy that an adventurous discovery can bring us. All of us have the capabilities to achieve greater things than we can imagine. All it takes is a step of courage and determination, holding out hope. Together as a school, we believe that 2025 will be one where we show kindness and support to each other as we take the leap of faith into the big adventure awaiting us. Let’s welcome the dawn of a new adventure! Aurora Odyssey!</p><p>

Yours Sincerely, <br>
Ms <u>Chew</u> Ing Lim<br>
Principal
