<p>The Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise allows schools to offer places to suitable students with outstanding talent areas before the release of their PSLE exam results. TKGS invites Primary 6 students who have the ability and potential to meet our listed criteria below to apply.</p>

<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</p>

<p>TKGS offers the following talent areas for DSA Exercise 2023:</p>
