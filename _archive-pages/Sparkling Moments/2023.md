  <h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
</center>
  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
    Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to recollect significant moments 
    that touched them in the year. We call it TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity 
    to express what they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling Moments 
    could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes. They are also cherished memories of school events like Leaders Investiture, and the moment of pride winning a class competition. 
    Or it could be times when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit 
    shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and TK Spirit Week. 
    More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are the simple, ordinary things we do in our 
    daily interactions that touch a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - 
    Little things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people and relationships. 
    May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!

Open to lower secondary students, teams can choose to either write or produce an investigative journalism report based on a selection of topics.

<h3><strong>TKGS collaborates with PUB to lead Geylang River Learning Trail in commemoration of Singapore World Water Day 2023</strong></h3>
TKGS is in our third year of championing water education with PUB. Our girls have benefited much in the process, bringing their classroom lessons on Singapore’s Water Story alive.<br>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/pub_top.png">
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/pub_lowermid.png">
Building on and building up this partnership, our girls took a leap of faith to design and conduct a Learning Trail for Kong Hwa School and Geylang Methodist School (Primary) students using Geylang River in our backyard as an outdoor classroom. The Primary School students enjoyed the learning journey and learned about the importance of water sustainability.

We are indeed happy that our girls are living out our school mission to become lifelong learners and good stewards of knowledge in service to the community and country.
