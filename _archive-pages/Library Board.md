<p>The Library Board is committed to promoting a strong reading culture and supporting the teaching and learning needs of the school.</p>
 
<p>All student librarians are encouraged to be avid readers themselves and participate actively in the library’s resource acquisition by researching on newly published books and sending in reviews and book recommendations.</p>

<p>They hone their public speaking skills in reaching out to the school community on reading, and gain ICT skills on Canva, PowerPoint and video making, in producing publicity materials on books and writers. They also participate in workshops organized by the National Library Board (NLB) e.g., storytelling, which helps them develop effective storytelling skills in outreach programmes such as the kidsREAD ViA. </p>

<p>In kidsREAD ViA, they contribute to the community as servant leaders and is matched with a primary school through NLB. As volunteers, they conduct planned reading activities for lower primary school students from less privileged backgrounds. </p>

<p>Through participation in external competitions such as the NLB Prove It! Contest and NLB Historical Scene Investigation (H.S.I.) Challenge, student librarians acquire skills such as research, information literacy, report writing and video making.</p>
