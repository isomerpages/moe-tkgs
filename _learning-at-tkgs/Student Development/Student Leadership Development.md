<h2>Key Beliefs</h2>
<ol class="s">
    <li>Guided by the practice of Servant Leadership and our belief that leadership is not positional, leadership in TKGS is purpose-driven towards serving the common good and its development anchored on character growth and excellence.</li>
    <li>Every student possesses a unique blend of abilities, inclinations and talents, and has the potential to be developed as a leader. When we focus on the ‘person’ and encourage our students to be self-reflective in their personal growth, they learn to leverage their strengths and develop a mindset that supports personal resilience and emotional agility. In doing so, we move our students towards self-assurance and help them discover their unique value as a leader.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tiered Leadership Development</h2>
<p>In TKGS, we adopt a three-tiered student leadership development approach to equip our students with the relevant knowledge and skills that empower them to serve beyond the school and make a difference to the community.</p>

For Tier 1, which caters to all, students learn the value of Servant Leadership and are equipped with skills such as Emotional Agility as part of the leadership curriculum they are exposed to. In addition, Lower Secondary students are taught the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership (by Kouzes and Posner). The general student body is also provided with opportunities to observe their seniors model leadership in action through the different activities planned for them by different leadership boards. It is this experience of learning from a good mix of peers who lead with different strengths and interests that we leverage to encourage our students to explore their own leadership identity and motivation. 
<br><br>
In raising TKGians as leaders, we seek to inculcate in our students the impassioned spirit to serve common good. For Tiers 2 and Tier 3, students who take on formal leadership roles are given training specific to their responsibilities. They are supported by Teacher Mentors to initiate ideas with their respective student groups. At the apex is the Student Leaders’ Network (SLN) where the top student leaders across the various student groups come together to form a strong community of support for one another and take responsibility in passing on their leadership learning and experiences to the student body. Student leaders in the SLN are actively engaged in the school’s decision-making process and training for them is provided through opportunities that allow them to collaborate with leaders from other boards, to deliberate ideas and voice their concerns as well as develop their ability to exercise critical and inventive thinking to engender positive change in school.
