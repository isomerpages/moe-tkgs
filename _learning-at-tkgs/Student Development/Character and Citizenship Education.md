<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: Platforms for Citizenship Education (CE) in TKGS</p>
<p>Citizenship Education (CE) in TKGS is delivered through a range of platforms, as shown in the above diagram. These include the explicit teaching of Citizenship Education lessons in LEGACY, the infusion of CE in the Instructional Programme, CE Learning Journeys, commemoration of the 4 core NE events and the Assembly Programme. In particular, CE in TKGS is aligned to the school&rsquo;s Values-in-Action programme where learning experiences have been designed for students to deepen their understanding and contribute to community issues that are of national interests.</p>
<p><strong>NE Commemorative Days</strong></p>
<p>TKGS commemorates 4 core NE events which have been identified as defining moments in Singapore's history. The aim is to entrench these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.</p>

<li><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our students today belong to a generation that are constantly connected. The open nature of the internet poses a danger to our students as it can expose them to undesirable content which may derail their value systems, and expose them to unnecessary harm.</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness in TKGS looks into the positive well-being of students as they navigate the cyberspace. It imparts TKGians with the norms of appropriate, responsible behaviour on technology use, as well as the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes on protecting oneself and others in the cyber world. It also looks into the positive physical and psychosocial well-being of TKGians in their use of mobile and internet technologies.</p>
