    <h3>OUR APPROACH TO STUDENT DEVELOPMENT</h3>
</div>

In TKGS, we see the TKGian to be more than a student, more than an achiever with accomplished performance outcomes. Fundamentally, we believe that there is a person in each and every one of our students. This person in our students must first grow healthily – physically, socially, emotionally and also in terms of character and values. It is when this person grows well that the TKGian can become the keen learner who is motivated and able to achieve her personal best. When this person grows healthily – secure and grounded in sound values, then she can be the leader that cares for others and serves the common good.

    <h3>TKGS STUDENT DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK</h3>
</div>

The TKGS Student Development framework seeks to provide every student in TKGS with the strongest foundation possible for them to reach their aspirations in learning and in life. It guides our focus to ‘Grow the Gracious Woman’ and ‘Raise the Servant Leader,’ and tells the story of our whole school approach towards Student Development.

The picture above illustrates the caring, affirming and enabling environment in TKGS, one established on good seeds (school values), good soil (school culture) and strong roots (quality relationships). As they feel secure and find their sense of place within this citadel of learning, TKGians are empowered to explore their strengths, enabling them to thrive and flourish like mighty oaks.
