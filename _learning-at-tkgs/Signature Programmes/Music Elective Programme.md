<p><strong>What the Programme is about<br /></strong>The Music Elective Programme aims to nurture students who would be:</p>
<p><strong>Scholars in the Arts<br /></strong>Well-informed musicians with a deep knowledge of music and its role in the society; passionate about learning and appreciative of music and other art forms.</p>
<p><strong>Practitioners in the Arts<br /></strong>Skilful, expressive and sensitive musicians with artistic integrity who will continually hone their craft and share the joy of music with others.</p>
<p><strong>Advocates for the Arts<br /></strong>Active participants and passionate contributors to music and the arts in the community.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders for the Arts<br /></strong>Champions of the arts with the passion to drive their vision for music and the arts in Singapore. Students can expect to be immersed in a musically enriched and vibrant learning environment, with extensive music-making opportunities such as Recitals and the Rest &amp; Relax programme organised by the school during recesses.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogical Approach and Assessment<br /></strong>In developing Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT) through the arts, the MEP unit has adopted and implemented the Capacities for Imaginative Thinking developed by the Lincoln Center Institute (LCI), New York in the teaching of Art and Music. These capacities are the skills necessary to the exploration, inquiry and deeper disciplinary understanding of any works in the Arts discipline. Using Thinking Routines as a vehicle in the development of these capacities, students are guided through the thinking process to develop Critical and Inventive Thinking, one of the key 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century skills.</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong></p>
<p><u>MEP Concert</u></p>
<p>The MEP Unit, together with the Arts Education Branch (AEB) at the MOE organizes the biennial MEP Concert where budding musicians and singers from various MEP schools in Singapore come together to put up a concert. The objectives of the MEP Concert are to develop students&rsquo; musical faculties through orchestral playing, and provide opportunities for students from different MEP centres to network and interact through music-making. Apart from orchestral playing, students are also selected to be part of choral, solo and ensemble performances.</p>

<p><u>Sec 3 National MEP Camp</u></p>
<p>The MEP Camp is an annual enrichment programme for all Secondary Three MEP students in Singapore. Since 1984, it has been organised by MOE and MEP teachers to stretch students&rsquo; learning and provide opportunities for students across schools to collaborate and interact with one another. During the camp, students get to meet fellow MEP students from various schools for collaborations in music-making and performing. They learn about genres and topics of Music outside the MEP syllabus, thus increasing their exposure to Music.</p>

<p><u>Student Exchange</u></p>
<p>In April, 2016, the Sec 2 MEP class attended a student exchange programme with Sekolah Indonesia Singapore (SIS). The focus of the exchange was on Indonesian Gamelan music and dance conducted by students and staff of Sekolah Indonesia Singapore (SIS). At the end of the workshop, the MEP students learnt to play a traditional Gamelan piece and perform a simple part of the Aceh Sumatra Dance. Despite some language barriers, friendships were formed through the sharing of the traditional art form.</p>
