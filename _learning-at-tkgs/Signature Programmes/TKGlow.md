<p>To promote student mental well-being and student advocacy, the school introduced TKGLOW!. GLOW! stands for:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow by sharing your interest or passion</li>
<li>Learn something new</li>
<li>Open mind</li>
<li>Worthwhile experience</li>
</ul>

<p>TKGLOW! gives students the space to explore new passions as each class gets to decide on the type of activities, which range from Sports to Aesthetics, to participate in. Student Leaders gather input from the student population on their interests, and submit proposed ideas to teachers-in-charge. Taking place after morning assemblies on even Fridays, TKGLOW! allows students to start the day with enjoyable and relaxing activities.</p>

<p>It is also a time for students to relax and take a break from the stressful academic curriculum. Students can then choose to take part in craft work like clay sculpting, marbling art, origami, bracelet making, learn to play musical instruments, and dabble in different sports. This structured platform is a form of Student-Initiated Learning and provides students an opportunity to learn new skills and develop 21CC competencies.</p>
