<p>To achieve the school mission of developing every student to be a leader, the school redefines leadership in terms of self-leadership and service to the community, regardless of rank, position and title. The concept of self-leadership is seen in the defining features of TKGians to be &lsquo;<em>Leaders of Character, Women of Grace</em>&rsquo;. This is reflected in our student management system which emphasises responsible decision-making and self-leadership via the Restorative Practice Approach and Traffic Light Monitoring System.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and reflect on the impact of their actions on others. Leadership through service is demonstrated through our 4-year ViA programme that challenges all TKGians to lead through service to the local and international community in need.</p>
