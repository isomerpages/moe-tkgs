<p>The school&rsquo;s signature programme, TKGS+ (Plus) aims to provide a differentiated curriculum which enables students to pursue interest-based learning. The variety of modules which students may offer over three years provide many opportunities for them to discover their interests and develop their talents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TKGS+ has incorporated elements of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP), the Four-Life Learning model, and Treffinger&rsquo;s Levels of Service in its framework and approach. This has allowed the programme to include larger segments of students in the programme, and ensure the design of purposeful and meaningful learning experiences to develop the future-readiness of students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through TKGS+, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover new interests and develop their talents,</li>
<li>Participate in joyful and authentic learning experiences,</li>
<li>Develop 21st century competencies, dispositions and values, and</li>
<li>Deepen disciplinarity while exploring interdisciplinarity understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>The broad-based approach for Lower Secondary provides all students exposure to a good breadth of modules over two years.</p>

<p>Secondary One students offer the &lsquo;Design Thinking&rsquo; and &lsquo;Code for Fun&rsquo; modules which will equip them with the critical thinking, creative problem-solving and coding skills they can apply in prototyping solutions for real-world problems. Since its pilot in 2021, a select class also participates in the &lsquo;Global Scholars Programme&rsquo;, giving them the opportunity to collaborate with international students on global issues such as global warming and food waste.</p>
<p>Secondary Two students are able to extend concepts learnt in the classroom through modules such as Tinkering, Computational Thinking, Animation, Heritage+ and many others. These modules offer opportunities for authentic learning experiences where students engage in hands-on activities and apply skills learnt to real-world situations.</p>

<p>Participation of TKGS+ is interest-based at Secondary Three where students may opt for projects which are extensions of selected Secondary Two modules. Through projects such as &lsquo;TKGS Heritage&rsquo; and &lsquo;<a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/tkgs-biodiversity/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greening Schools for Biodiversity</a>&rsquo;, students learn more advanced content and instructions while working on problems that require a more interdisciplinary approach to innovation and problem-solving.</p>
<p>In addressing challenges at the school and community level, students exercise stewardship of learning, developing not just 21st century competencies, but also dispositions and values such as resilience and empathy which are necessary for them to be life-long learners and contributors of society.</p>
