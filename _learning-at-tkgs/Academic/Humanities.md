<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>Alternative Assessment tasks, built into the curriculum, enable students to apply the skills acquired during Humanities lessons and understand the relevance of such skills in the real world. In keeping with innovative teaching strategies, the department uses a myriad of ICT tools such as Google-classroom, Mentimeter, Padlet and Kahoot to engage our students. Of particular mention here is the infusion of Virtual Reality in lessons where students immerse themselves in an experience that takes them up close to a volcano during an explosion and feel the wildlife in a rainforest. Historical heritage sites are also within easy reach of the students and learning transforms to a rich experience.</p>

<p>"Model United Nations Humanities Department invites students to participate is the Model United Nations (MUN) conference. This conference is a simulation of the actual UN. During such conferences, student participants role-play as delegates, assuming the role of national representatives in their respective councils. Delegates then engage in rigorous debate on pertinent global issues, and experience the complexities of international policy formation first-hand, all while prioritising their country&rsquo;s national interests in developing solutions to international issues. Students are challenged to think out of the box for insightful solutions, build their leadership and speaking abilities, and engage in intellectually stimulating discussions. Ultimately, Model UN conferences groom students into more responsible global citizens, cognizant of pressing global issues, and daring to create impactful solutions. "</p>
