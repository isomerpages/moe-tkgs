<li>INquire like Scientists whereby they are able to think and act in ways that model after skilled practitioners.&nbsp;</li>
<li>INnovate using Science whereby students apply their understanding of Science to generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems, while being cognisant of the limitations of the discipline.&nbsp;</li>
