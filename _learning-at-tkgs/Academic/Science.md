<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>In the classrooms and laboratories, the main approach to excite and engage young minds is through the inquiry-based learning approach which is aligned to the MOE&rsquo;s Science Curriculum Framework. The efforts of the TKGS Science Department is focused on enacting experiences that enable students to be&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>INspired by Science whereby they enjoy learning Science; see the relevance of the discipline in their everyday life and how the way of thinking can be used to solve many global challenges.</li>
<li>INquire like Scientists whereby they are able to think and act in ways that model after skilled practitioners.&nbsp;</li>
<li>INnovate using Science whereby students apply their understanding of Science to generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems, while being cognisant of the limitations of the discipline.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<strong>TKGS Plus Biodiversity</strong>
<p>TKGS Plus Biodiversity is offered by the Science teachers as part of the TKGS Plus Programme. Offered to students at Secondary Three and in partnership with NParks, students learn and apply Biodiversity survey techniques used in real world (e.g. transect techniques) to study the effects of environmental conditions on species abundance.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Advanced Electives Modules</strong>
<p>The Advanced Electives Modules for Science are organised for students, in partnership with Tertiary Institutes to enrich the secondary school curriculum with more applied learning options. Held over 30 hours, AEMs are modules in applied sciences where students will be given opportunities to apply knowledge they learn during the programme to practical real-life scenarios, discover their strengths and ignite their passion for this field of study.</p>
