It articulates our beliefs in the purpose of school, understanding of our learnersâ€™ profile, what we believe our students should learn for them to be future-ready, how we teach to develop the requisite knowledge, skills and dispositions of TKGians. The Framework is succinctly represented by the Lamp, which is one of five symbols in the school badge. It symbolises our continual quest for knowledge and learning.</p>
