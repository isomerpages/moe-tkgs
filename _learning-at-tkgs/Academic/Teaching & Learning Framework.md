<h4><strong>TKGS Teaching and Learning Framework</strong></h4>
<p>Our Teaching and Learning Framework is a roadmap that helps our teachers work towards a shared vision for TKGians. Like the lamp – a symbol of learning and curiosity – the TKGS approach to teaching and learning illuminates the path to developing inquisitive learners who are eager to discover and grow. It connects why, what, and how we teach, ensuring every teacher understands how they help our TKGians grow as a whole person.</p>

<b>What Our Students Learn</b>
<p>At the heart of our framework is Life-worthy Learning, education where our students learn not just for themselves, but to serve the common good. This means developing Lifelong Learning that never stops, Life-wide Learning that happens everywhere from classrooms to real-world contexts, Life-deep Learning that goes beyond memorising facts to create meaningful understanding, and Life-wise Learning that builds strong values, good character, and practical wisdom for making decisions that benefit others. Through this shared understanding, we create an environment where every TKGian learns not for personal gain alone, but to serve others and make the world a better place, becoming compassionate stewards who lead to serve the common good.</p>

<b>How We Teach</b>
<p>Our teaching approach is built on knowing our students, understanding their strengths, interests, and learning needs so we can meet each child where they are. We cultivate a culture of trust and growth, in classrooms where every student feels safe to take risks, ask questions, and learn from mistakes. Our teachers use responsive pedagogies that adapt to how students learn best, whether through hands-on activities, collaborative discussions, or creative projects. We also see assessment not as judgement, but as a conversation providing timely, meaningful feedback that helps students understand their progress and guides them towards their next step. This personalised approach ensures that every TKGian feels valued, challenged, and supported on their unique learning journey.
