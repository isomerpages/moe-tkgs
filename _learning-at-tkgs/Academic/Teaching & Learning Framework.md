They are, </p><p>1) Provide joyful/ purposeful learning experiences, </p><p>2) Prepare students to be future-ready and </p><p>3) Provide a nurturing and inclusive space.</p><p>At the centre/core of the lamp is what we aspire our students to learn, termed as life-worthy learning. Their learning should be life-wide, life-deep, lifelong and life-wise. The classroom practices or how we teach are symbolically represented by the handle. They are, Know our Learners, Responsive Pedagogies, Positive Classroom Culture, and Assessment and Feedback. The ten learning dispositions of the Inquisitve Learners are represented by the flame.</p>
