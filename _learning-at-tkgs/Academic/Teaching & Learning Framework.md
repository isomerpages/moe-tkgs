<p></p><h4><strong>The TKGS Teaching and Learning Framework</strong></h4><p>The TKGS Teaching and Learning Framework guides teachers in their everyday decisions in the classroom. It articulates our beliefs in the purpose of school, understanding of our learners’ profile, what we believe our students should learn for them to be future-ready, how we teach to develop the requisite knowledge, skills and dispositions of TKGians. The Framework is succinctly represented by the Lamp, which is one of five symbols in the school badge. It symbolises our continual quest for knowledge and learning.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/LearningTKGS/Academic/TKGS_Teaching_and_Learning_Framework_Final.jpg"></div><p></p>
