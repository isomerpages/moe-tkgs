<strong>Drama Education &amp; Oral Communication</strong>
<p>As part of the TKGS English language curriculum, students hone their oral communication skills through the Drama Education and Oral Communication modules. Apart from building proficiency in the technical skills of speaking well, students engage confidently in public speaking and drama presentations. They are given opportunities to creatively explore different modes of expression and appreciate the nuances of language use. </p>

<strong>Literature Journaling</strong>
<p>The Literature Journal fosters independent reading and self-directed learning as students make their own notes during lessons and connect ideas explored in texts with personal experiences or other texts/issues discussed. This allows them to actively reflect on their own learning as they record their questions and reflections, empowering them to examine their own learning processes.</p>

<strong>Learning Journey – Plays &amp;  Performances</strong>
<p>Our Learning Journeys seek to complement English language and Literature learning by immersing students in real-world examples of what they study in class. They bring literary elements and language use to life, deepening students' understanding and appreciation for texts. Through these performances, students learn to analyse storytelling, character development, and language in action, strengthening their critical thinking and perspective-taking.</p>
