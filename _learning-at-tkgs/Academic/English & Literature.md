<li><strong>Discerning &amp; Critical Readers</strong>&nbsp;who possess broad worldviews by reading widely and staying well-informed, evaluate information with discernment and a questioning mind, and appreciate the nuances of language and the contexts in which literary texts are written and read</li>
<li><strong>Creative Inquirers &amp; Meaning-Makers</strong>&nbsp;who possess the capacity to explore and navigate multiple perspectives and ambiguities in real world contexts, so as to creatively synthesise information to co-construct knowledge and their interpretations of texts</li>

<strong>EL Reading Portfolio</strong>
<p>The English Reading Portfolio empowers students in the development of their critical thinking skills, while also enabling them to build their vocabulary and become more confident speakers in engaging with social issues. Students gather texts and articulate their opinions of current issues, thus building their content knowledge as well as critical thinking skills in engaging with multiple perspectives.</p>

<strong>Literature Journaling</strong>
<p>The Literature Journal fosters independent reading and self-directed learning as students make their own notes during lessons and connect ideas explored in texts with personal experiences or other texts/issues discussed. This allows them to actively practise Assessment for Learning as they record their questions and reflections, empowering them to examine their own learning processes.</p>
