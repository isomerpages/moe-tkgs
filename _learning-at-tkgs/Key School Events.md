<p>At TKGS, we place a lot of emphasis on the holistic development of our students. We believe that learning is not limited to within the walls of a classroom. Therefore, many of our programme allow our students to acquire skills and dispositions beyond the academic subjects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the school’s efforts to encourage students’ voice and develop student leadership skills, many of these activities are student-initiated, interest-based activities led by our student leaders. Please scroll down to view some of these activities.</p>
