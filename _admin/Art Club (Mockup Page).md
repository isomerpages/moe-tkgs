As a member of our art club, you can expect to engage in a variety of hands-on activities and workshops that allow you to explore different art mediums and techniques. You will get to experience everything from resin art to digital art, mixed media, and more.

During our resin art workshop, members had the opportunity to experiment with different types of pigment, colours, and additives to create works of art with clarity, luminosity, brilliance, and depth. We also had a chance to try out the UV ray machine to help dry our coasters and keychains.

Our digital art workshops allowed members to explore the use of iPads and different apps to create individual characters and short comics based on various themes. We also had mixed media workshops where we combined different mediums to create cohesive works of art.

As a member, you'll have the freedom to make your own artistic choices and hone your skills using your aesthetic senses. With support from our instructors, you'll learn new techniques and expand your ideas of what art can be.
