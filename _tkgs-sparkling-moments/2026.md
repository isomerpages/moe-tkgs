<h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
<p>Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to
recollect significant moments that touched them in the year. We call it
TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity to express what
they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling
Moments could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes.
They are also cherished memories of school events like Leaders Investiture,
and the moment of pride winning a class competition. Or it could be times
when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit
shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and
TK Spirit Week. More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are
the simple, ordinary things we do in our daily interactions that touch
a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - Little
things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people
and relationships. May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!</p>

<h3><strong>A Meaningful Start: Building Bonds Through Cohort Experiences</strong></h3>

<p>The school gates flew open after the two-month break, welcoming TKGians with the highly anticipated cohort experiences. This unforgettable tradition provided countless opportunities for students to connect deeply with classmates, fostering new friendships and belonging from the first days of school.</p>
 
<p>From class banner painting to bouldering, the wide range of activities created an excellent platform for TKGians and TKChers to make cherished memories together. These shared experiences encouraged teamwork, resilience, and mutual support whilst reflecting on the school's values.</p>

<p>'At first, when I joined TKGS, I was quite apprehensive of what was to come, but my Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) were very welcoming, and they made me feel like I belonged. The most memorable experience for me was definitely the campfire night because it was very fun and a great way to the start of the year!' shares Mariam Binte Mohammed Faizal (1I2).</p>

<p>'My cohort experience was fun as I got to bond with my friends and make memories with them. The museum visit was very interesting and educational, and I got to learn a lot of new things,' shares Anatolia Deschambeault (2R6).</p>

<p> 'The cycling experience was very interesting as I had never cycled such a long distance before, and it really helped me to get to know my new classmates,' shares Natasha Lee (3C3).</p>

<p>'Personally, bouldering was challenging as I had to overcome my limitations, but the motivation of reaching the top gave me great satisfaction,' reflects Raeann Loke (4H4).</p>

<p>'Being an OGL to Sec 1s was very rewarding. It was amazing to see the potential prefects step up, showing their leadership qualities,' reminisced Janelle Pang (4R1), Prefectorial Board Executive Committee (PB EXCO), Head of Secretariat.</p>

<p>The week ended with the long-awaited campfire, where students sang and danced under the stars, embodying their hard work and camaraderie. The cohort experience was truly a memorable and meaningful start to the school year.</p>

<h3><strong>Innofest: Believe Big Innovate Bold Empower All</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2026/inno26_hero.png">
<p>InnoFest 2026 was an inspiring day of learning for our staff. Under the theme "Believe Big. Innovate Bold. Empower All," teachers gathered to share creative ways to help our students learn, reinforcing our belief that every student has the potential to succeed.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2026/inno26_1a.png">

<p>A highlight was the exchange of ideas on using tech tools like SALiS and SchoolAI to help students become more self-directed. Beyond the screen, innovation was everywhere; teachers showcased students building lung models in Science, conducting Geographical Investigations in urban neighbourhoods, and using gamified activities to master Music theory. </p>

<p>Each sharing reflected our commitment to believing big in our students' capabilities—seeing beyond surface behaviours to recognise the kinesthetic learner who needs movement, the visual processor who thrives with hands-on models, and the collaborative thinker who excels in group investigations.</p>
