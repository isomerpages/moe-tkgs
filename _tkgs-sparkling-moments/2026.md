<h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
<p>Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to
recollect significant moments that touched them in the year. We call it
TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity to express what
they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling
Moments could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes.
They are also cherished memories of school events like Leaders Investiture,
and the moment of pride winning a class competition. Or it could be times
when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit
shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and
TK Spirit Week. More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are
the simple, ordinary things we do in our daily interactions that touch
a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - Little
things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people
and relationships. May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!</p>

<p>The week kicked off with a show of gratitude towards our support staff—our heroes behind the scenes. These dedicated individuals work tirelessly to keep our school running smoothly, and to recognize their invaluable contributions, our student leaders presented them with specially designed tote bags and filled them with thoughtful goodies.</p>
<p>Next, our students ventured out of their classrooms to discover new passions, forge stronger bonds, and connect with the world outside the classroom walls. </p>
