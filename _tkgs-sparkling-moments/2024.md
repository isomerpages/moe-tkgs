  <h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
</center>
  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
    Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to recollect significant moments 
    that touched them in the year. We call it TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity 
    to express what they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling Moments 
    could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes. They are also cherished 
    of school events like Leaders Investiture, and the moment of pride winning a class competition. 
    Or it could be times when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit 
    shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and TK Spirit Week. 
    More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are the simple, ordinary things we do in our 
    daily interactions that touch a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - 
    Little things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people and relationships. 
    May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!

<h3><strong>MOE-OBS Camp 2024</strong></h3>
Our Secondary 3 cohort embarked on a significant part of their secondary school education experience in Term One. They participated in the MOE-OBS Camp with students from 3 other schools.<br><br>
Basking under the sun, our TKGians gained the valuable opportunity to get close to sand and sea during the 5D4N camp. Various activities helped them get to know other students from different schools as they took on the challenge of both land and sea expeditions. The high elements and team building activities imbued a stronger self-belief and the tenacity and adaptability to face ambiguous situations. <br><br>
Our girls came back with many exciting stories to share!

“OBS gave me the opportunity to establish new friendships with people of different backgrounds, connect with nature, and allowed me to learn and apply values like perseverance and teamwork. I learnt to be grateful for everything I have,” says Victoria Ng (3C3), second from right.

“I met some obstacles and even had disagreements with my OBS group mates. But I took them as  learning experiences and chose to persevere,” says Cyneveah Cheang (3I2) centre with two thumbs up. “In the end, I managed to achieve many great things including reaching our final destination after kayaking for 5 hours in open sea waters and under the blazing hot sun!” 


<h3><strong>TKGlow</strong></h3>
As the first term came to a close, excitement filled the air during our bi-weekly TKGlow! session on 23 February. This session was extra special because it was  put together by The Student Leaders' Network (SLN)! They canvassed ideas from their friends to plan a programme to help classes explore new interests and strengthen their relationships as a class.

Each class had the chance to choose from a variety of activities, ranging from sports to aesthetics. With enthusiasm bubbling over, the student leaders took charge, guiding their classmates through activities like making phone charms, or rose bracelets, balloon sculpting, and even sports like Captains' Ball and Frisbee.

The atmosphere was electric as laughter and camaraderie filled every corner of the school grounds. Every activity was a testament to the creativity and teamwork among the students.

Our school participated in Singapore’s inaugural Total Defence Exercise. TKGS was one of forty schools selected for the Food Resilience Experience. To simulate food disruption, all canteen stalls were closed on Total Defence Day. Students and staff were only able to eat food packs prepared by Singapore Food Agency for lunch. This experience emphasised the importance of food security, being adaptable and resilient.<br>

Besides the Food Resilience Experience, our students and staff also learned more about how we can contribute to the defence of Singapore through various enriching activities. A big thank you to our uniformed groups and the officers from the Singapore Police Force and Civil Defence Force for sharing your insights with us!

TKGS hosted a Chinese New Year celebration to usher in the year of the
Dragon. We invited parents as well as senior residents from Mountbatten
to join in the festivities.<br><br>
To kick start the celebrations, our students unleashed their creativity
with dragon themed decor for their classrooms. They also put together hampers
for our invited guests. Next, was a reunion class breakfast to enjoy delicious
treats and strengthen bonds with their classmates and teachers.

Following the class activities, we convened in the hall for a concert
brimming with various performances, including calligraphy, martial arts,
acapella by our own students, and a cultural dance performance by the Singapore
Chinese Dance Theatre. An unexpected highlight was the appearance of our
TKGS alumnus - Loh Xuan Yan, Carys of class 2023 who treated us to a medley
of Chinese New Year songs.<br><br>
The celebration ended on a high note, with the gifting of oranges, representing
prosperity and happiness, to our staff, seniors, and parents. It was an
unforgettable event filled with meaningful conversations and gratitude.
