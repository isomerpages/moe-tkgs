  <h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
</center>
  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
    Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to recollect significant moments 
    that touched them in the year. We call it TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity 
    to express what they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling Moments 
    could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes. They are also cherished memories of school events like Leaders Investiture, and the moment of pride winning a class competition. 
    Or it could be times when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit 
    shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and TK Spirit Week. 
    More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are the simple, ordinary things we do in our 
    daily interactions that touch a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - 
    Little things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people and relationships. 
    May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!

<h3><strong>Class of 2024 Graduation: A day of Farewells and Beginnings</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/GDN_hero.png">

<p>On 20 September, our Sec 4 classes marked a bittersweet milestone with their long-awaited graduation. The school hall, transformed into a vibrant wonderland, was the perfect setting for this celebration of their secondary school journey.</p>

<p>The celebrations kickstarted in the morning with a rousing fanfare as the graduating class walked into the school hall to thunderous applause. The morning assembly was then spent on the journey of this graduating batch, from the different milestones to challenges that shaped them into the fine women they are.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/GDN_1.png">

<p>In the evening, the hall was transformed into a vibrant space to welcome our guests for Grad Nite. Our students came dressed in their finest attire, radiating elegance. Laughter and music filled the air, as friendships were cemented and memories made. From performances by our students and even parents to speeches by the class leaders, the evening clearly showed the strong bonds that had been forged over the years.</p>

<p>“I feel a mix of sadness and gratitude. These four years flew by really quickly and I’m really grateful for all my friends and teachers that helped me throughout this journey, making my time in TKGS unforgettable,” reflects Teng Jing Yi (4I2).</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/GDN_3.png"><br>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/GDN_2.png">

<p>One of the highlights of the evening was the inspiring address by our alumni - Jewelle Woo and Shruti Ravindran (Class of 2015). Their return serves as a powerful reminder of the school's legacy and the opportunities that await our graduating class. They shared their personal journeys, offering valuable insights and words of encouragement for our students as they embark on their own adventures.</p>

<p>“The future is wide open for us, and though we might stumble along the way, we’ll get back up. We’re ready to face whatever comes next, whether it’s O Levels, our further studies, or finally catching up on all the sleep we have missed out on,” shares Priya Ramesh and Liaw Ann Sze (4H4). </p>

<p>A bittersweet symphony of farewells and beginnings, the night drew to a close, leaving an indelible mark on all who attended. It was not just a celebration of achievements but a poignant send-off, a reminder that while one chapter closed, another, filled with endless possibilities, was just beginning.</p>

<h3><strong>Celebrating our Teachers</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/TD24_hero.png">

<p>Teachers' Day at TKGS was a whirlwind of excitement and gratitude as students came together to express their deepest appreciation for the tireless dedication of their teachers. Providing the teachers with a valuable reprieve, our students took the lead while teachers sat back and enjoyed a morning of festivities.</p>

<p>The day kicked off with a vibrant morning of classroom parties where students took the reins, showcasing their creativity and leadership skills. From heartfelt tributes to engaging games, the morning was a testament to the students' appreciation for their teachers.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/TD24_1.png">

<p>As the day progressed, the festivities continued with a captivating concert in the hall. Teachers, accompanied by their class chairpersons, were greeted with beautifully designed tote bags designed by the Class Committee Exco. The concert that followed after was a showcase of talent, featuring lively games and performances that left everyone entertained and inspired.</p>

<p>“Organising Teacher's Day to express our gratitude to the teachers was an absolute joy for both my board and me. This event was heart-warmingly special to us, and we’d love nothing more than to do it all over again,” says Leo Kit, President, Class Committee Exco.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/TD24_2.png">

<p>The afternoon brought a different kind of celebration as our staff gathered at the Amara Hotel for the annual Teachers' Day lunch. The theme, "Old School," transported everyone back in time as some teachers donned their old school uniforms, including our iconic TKGS green pinafores, while others transformed themselves into retro teachers of the past.</p>

<p>From an engaging quiz which challenged staff to discover little-known facts about their coworkers to a lively relay-charades game, the lunch was a time for camaraderie, laughter, and reminiscence.  
As the event drew to a close, the TKGS family gathered for a group photo, symbolizing the unity and camaraderie that defines the school's culture. This Teachers' Day lunch not only honored the dedication of TKGS educators but also reinforced the strong bonds that make our school community so special.</p>


<h3><strong>Together, As One United People</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/NDP_Hero.png">

<p>Despite a brief morning shower, the spirits were high at TKGS as we celebrated Singapore's 59th birthday. The festivities kicked off with a rousing National Day Observance Parade and a dazzling display by our Uniformed Groups.
In classrooms across the school, students delved into what made Singapore special. Lower secondary and Sec 4 students reflected on their gratitude, while Sec 3 students explored the significance of citizenship during a heartwarming NRIC Presentation Ceremony.
</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/NDP_c1r.png">

<p>The National Day concert was a highlight, with the house captains setting the stage for a memorable evening. An external music band treated us to a beautiful rendition of National Day songs, followed by a fascinating sharing session by the Sec 3 CCE Subject about their NE Show experiences. A fun-filled National Day Quiz tested our knowledge of Singapore, and the excitement reached a fever pitch when Xi An Gao Xin High School joined in with a song about chasing dreams. The iconic NDP Mascot, August, also made a special appearance, leading us in a lively Dance of Nation and Sing-along session.</p>
<p>"The best part was the sing-along to nostalgic national day songs," shared Yap Rui Yi, 3C3. "Everyone was so enthusiastic, dancing, singing, and clapping along. It was a truly lively atmosphere."</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/NDP_SLs.png">

<p>In addition to the vibrant celebrations, TKGS was also honored to receive three prestigious awards that showcased our commitment to community service and nation-building. The Community In Nature (CIN) Schools Award recognized our efforts in biodiversity conservation, while the Community Placemaking Award celebrated our students' artwork at Tanjong Katong MRT station. Our sustained contributions to the Mountbatten community were further acknowledged with the People's Association Community Spirit Award. These awards serve as a testament to our school's dedication to making a positive impact on our society and home - Singapore.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/NDP_c2.png">
<p>To make the celebration even more meaningful, seniors from the Mountbatten community were invited to join us. This joint celebration, uniting staff, students, guests from Xi An, and the Mountbatten seniors, perfectly embodied the year's theme, "Together, As One United People." It reminded us of the importance of coming together and playing our part to shape a brighter future for ourselves and those around us.</p>


<h3><strong>Beyond the Classroom: An Intercultural Experience</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/XA24_hero.png">
<p>5 August 2024 was an exciting day for TKGS, as we welcomed 40 students and eight teachers from Xi-an Gaoxin No. 1 Middle School, China, for a week-long school exchange programme. As part of the exchange programme, the visiting delegation participated in a myriad of activities to create precious memories with their schoolmates and local buddies. </p>

<p>“My Xi-an buddy experience was great! I managed to practise speaking in Chinese as well as interact with students from a different country. I learnt more about their culture and enjoyed the stories they shared,” shares Elena Heng (2H4). </p>

<p>The activities included classroom and CCA experiences with their Sec 2 local buddies and a basketball friendly match. The Chinese students and teachers also took part in the National Day Celebrations and visited the National Gallery Singapore. </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/XA24_1.png">
<p>“I am extremely grateful to be given the opportunity to represent our school to host the Xi-an students. I realised that although we may come from different countries, we are still similar in so many ways. Our hearts still lie as one, with our similar interests and passions that allow us to connect with one another,” reflects Rochelle Tan (2R1).</p>

<p>Indeed, this intercultural experience provided a valuable opportunity for students from both schools to broaden their perspectives, enhance their social and language skills and develop a deeper respect for cultural differences. </p>


<h3><strong>Sports Carnival: A Day of Spirit, Sports, and Smiles!</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/SC_hero.png">

<p>The highly anticipated TKGS Sports Carnival 2024 was held on 28 June at the Temasek Polytechnic Stadium. Held on the Friday before Youth Day, this year’s celebration was more than just a day of sports—it was a vibrant celebration of our school spirit and commitment to leading active, healthy lives.</p>

<p>The very first whistle marked the beginning of loud cheers that demonstrated the TKGS school spirit as students from all Houses sprinted onto the track amidst passionate encouragement from their peers. Runners dashed through the 100m, 4x100m, and the ever-exciting 8x50m relay event that was given an extra layer of excitement as our beloved teachers joined the race, making it a truly memorable moment of teamwork and camaraderie.</p><p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/SC_c1.png">
	
</p><p>For many, our yearly sports carnival is not just just about the races—it celebrates the incredible sense of community and support.</p>


<p>"The sports carnival this year was extremely fun and eventful, clearly showcasing the TKGS spirit," shares Esther Ebenezer John (2I2). "Seeing the whole school come together in their various Houses to cheer their teammates on encouraged students to put in their best effort to bring glory to their House."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fun didn’t stop on the track! The carnival shifted gears for the Sports and Novelty Games segment, where the action was just as intense. With Inter-House Games happening simultaneously across the field and indoor sports hall, everyone was fully engaged, cheering on their teams and playing their hearts out. The determination to win for their House was visible in every match!</p>

<p>Adding a twist of fun and rivalry, this year’s carnival featured special staff versus student challenges in Captain’s Ball and Frisbee. Laughter echoed through the stadium as students seized the opportunity to show their teachers who’s boss—at least for the day!&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To me, what made the sports carnival fun was the events where students could compete with the teachers, especially with the school leaders," says Laurel Siaw Ruo Qi (3C3).&nbsp;</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/SC_c2r.png">

<p>Of course, no TKGS House event is complete without a display of House Spirit! The House Committee led the charge, rallying their members to cheer with all their might. The chants and cheers that filled the stadium weren’t just about winning; they embodied our determination, unity, and pride in everything we do at TKGS.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/SC_T1.png">

<p>In the end, it was Teresa House that took home the coveted overall title, but every House left a winner in spirit. A huge thank you to everyone who participated, from the athletes to the organizers, for making the day unforgettable. We can’t wait to see even more thrilling action at next year’s Sports Carnival!</p>

<p>Let’s keep the spirit alive, TKGS! 🎉</p>


<h3><strong>Sounds of Iridescence Combined CCA Concert</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/cc_hero.png">

<p>Our TKGS Symphonic Band and String Ensemble came together to perform at our very first combined CCA concert titled Sounds of Iridescence.</p>
<p>Under the baton of Band Conductor, Ms Sia Swee Suan and String Ensemble Conductor, Mr Jersher Loi, both CCAs showcased pieces of different genres, moods and across time periods - much to the delight of our audience members at the SOTA Concert Hall.</p>
<p>The concert provided a myriad of opportunities for our Symphonic Band and String Ensemble CCA members to showcase their skills which they had put in so much effort to hone.</p>
<p>“The most important thing I learnt was that teamwork and hard work makes the dream work. Indeed, as long as we put our heart and soul into perfecting our performance, we would achieve spectacular results” says trumpeter, Genevieve Chua (3H4).</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/cc_n01.png">

<p>The highlight of the concert was when both CCAs came together at the finale to perform as one orchestra. “It was very eye-opening as we got to experience a whole new set of sounds from instruments some of us had never even seen or heard before.” says viola player, Dayna Maha (3H4). </p>
<p>Certainly, hearing the two CCAs produce an incredibly harmonious and delightful sound made the whole experience even more unique and memorable.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/cc_n2.png">

<p>This concert also celebrated our school spirit as our teachers and alumni join the Symphonic Band and String Ensemble to perform on stage.</p>
 <p>"I got a better understanding of the challenges my students faced as I played together with them, as well as the satisfaction of a successful performance with the very students I nurture,” shares Mr Lee Wei Xun. </p>
<p>A special shoutout to our talented teachers: Mrs Cherry Goh, Mrs Serena Chen, Mr Lee Wei Xun and Mr Yang Hsiu Chen who participated in the concert together with our Alumni Trudy Chen and Nellie Teow!</p>


<h3><strong>SYF Youth Station 'Live' 2024</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/YS_hero2.jpg">

<p>The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is a series of events organised by MOE for students to showcase their talents, artistic expression and creative voice. The Youth Station Live! is a SYF platform that is dedicated to showcasing student’s original creative work in music. Through this platform, student-musicians are provided with opportunities to further develop their interest and skills in songwriting, music arranging, production and performing. After their songs were selected, MOE made possible for the songwriters a fruitful e-mentoring session with a professional songwriter to discuss the merits of their song and how improvements can be made. </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/YS_bts1.png">

<p>This year, TKGS had two songs selected and they were:<br>
“Hero Too” by Thawdar Hnin Htet Kaylen (3C3)  <br>
“Daisy” by Ni Wayan Tara Shakila Binte Andiyanta, Tanya Sandeep Nair and Esther John (2I2)<br></p>
<p>Both songs were presented at the “Youth Station Live!” SYF Celebration event at The Pod (National Library) over the Youth Day weekend to screams of delight and support from school leader, teachers, parents and friends.</p>
<p>Here is Kaylen performing her song “Hero Too”.</p>

<h3><strong>Riding the Waves of Change</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/ma_hero.jpg">

<p>To celebrate the opening of the Tanjong Katong MRT Station on the Thomson-East Coast line, students from our school, guided by Mdm Kavitha were invited to design a mural to be displayed at the station. </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/ma_a1.png">
<p>Titled 'Riding the Waves of Change', this artwork portrays Katong’s transformation from a charming Peranakan enclave to a modern urban district, projecting into a dynamic future. Central to this narrative is the now extinct Katong Turtle. It is a symbol of our treasured history and commitment to sustainability as we continue to ride the waves of change. </p>
<p>“In my contribution to the mural, I used watercolour pencils to shade and colour the turtle to make it come alive. I also learnt the history of the Tanjong Katong area and how its name came to be.” says student artist Leah Tan (3R1)</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/ma_a2.png">
<p>On 24 June, we  had the honour of presenting the artwork to Mr. Lim Biow Chuan, Advisor to Mountbatten SMC, celebrating our efforts to bring the arts to our community. 
If you are around the area, do swing by the station to enjoy the mural! </p>


<h3><strong>EAS Learning Journey</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/EASLJ_june.png">

<p>The School Administration Team visited the Green Lab Singapore on 3rd June, where we learned about their pioneering efforts in sustainability. We were introduced to Green Lab's mission to become a one-stop provider for sustainable solutions and their latest innovation, the Casaa 180™, a plant-based biodegradable bag. The tour offered us a glimpse into their production line, showcasing how the bags, as well as products such as compostable food-grade containers and even books, were made. The session ended with us making our very own Bioplastic bowl as a souvenir to take home.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/EASLJ_june2.png">
<p>Mdm Rohayah Bte Sarpin, our Operations Support Officer, offered the following insight on the session:</p>
<p>"I caught a behind-the-scenes glimpse of how businesses are working towards a more sustainable future. The session also reminded us that there is no replacement for our planet Earth and we should do our part to preserve it."</p>

<h3><strong>Term 2 TK Spirit Week</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/TKSW_CP.jpg">

<p>Our students ended the semester on a high with TKGS Spirit Week! A signature programme for our school, our students participated in a myriad of activities, creating shared memories with their cohort and classes, as they took learning beyond the classroom.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/T2_SW1.png">
<p>This included a visit to the Bird Paradise for the Secondary One students, learning journeys to various institutions as part of the Secondary Two Career Seminar and a Heritage Trail of the TKGS Neighbourhood for the Secondary Three students.</p>

<p>The TKGS Spirit Week was especially memorable for the Secondary Four students. With a focus on self-directed class experiences, C-SPARKS in TKGS allowed the graduating cohort to organise their self-initiated final class activity before graduation. The students had great fun as they came up with creative ideas such as ice-skating lessons at Kallang Ice World and picnics at East Coast Park. </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/T2_SW2.png">
<p>“The high point for me this year was C Sparks where we played at the beach, took photos, sang songs and played volleyball. Everyone was just having fun together,” quipped Nur Erynna Ng (4S5) </p>

<h3><strong> Student Leaders’ Investiture</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/LI24_1.png">
<p>The annual Leaders' Investiture is a cherished event, celebrating the honour bestowed upon our student leaders to lead and serve the school community. During the investiture, we meaningfully invested our Sec 3 Student Leaders into the four leadership boards: Class Committee, CCA Leaders, House Committee, and the Prefectorial Board. 
	<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/LI24_2.png">	
This was done whilst formally recognizing the contributions and legacy of our Sec 4 Student Leaders. The heads of each board took to the stage to introduce their members, express gratitude to the Sec 4 leaders, and warmly welcome the new Sec 3 leaders.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/LI24_3.png">
<p>This year, we had the privilege of having Dr Tan Lai Yong to grace the occasion as our guest speaker. Dr Tan captivated the audience with inspiring stories from his life in Yunnan, China, sharing invaluable lessons on resilience, community service and leadership. His words left a profound impact on both the student leaders and the school community.</p>
<p>The ceremony culminated with all leaders taking the Leaders' Creed, pledging their commitment to uphold the values and responsibilities of their roles. It was a moment of pride and promise for the future.</p>

<h3><strong>Hari Raya and Tamil New Year Celebration</strong></h3>
<p>On April 26th, our school came together to celebrate Hari Raya and the Tamil New Year. The celebrations kickstarted with a Hari Raya performance by Wira Budaya. The lively skit provided insights into the global celebrations of Ramadan and Hari Raya. It then culminated in a spirited dance performance to the tune of Alamak Raya Lagi, where our students and staff jumped at the chance to join the performers on stage. The atmosphere was electric with shouts of encouragement as they gamely danced to the beat.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/HRTNY_1.png">
<p>“The skit helped me to better understand what my peers go through during Ramadan and Hari Raya and I gained a new appreciation of Malay food and culture.” says Dayna Maha (3H4).</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/HRTNY_2.png">
<p>Next, AKT Creations took to the stage to share more about how the Tamil New Year is celebrated. They presented a  rich and colourful medley of Tamil traditional art forms which included the Mayilattam (peacock dance) and Puravi Attam (horse dance). The performances were accompanied with live music played on the traditional Mathalam drum. “The concert was very fun! I loved it when the teachers were called on stage to try out dancing as a horse!” shares Sana Raghuraman (1I2). </p>


<h3><strong>Girl Guides East Division Day</strong></h3>
<p>On 26 April 2024, TKGS played host to Brownies and Guides from 35 secondary and primary schools in commemoration of the Girl Guides East Division Day (EDD). It was an honour to serve the Girl Guides community in providing a space to promote leadership, service and personal development growth.  This year’s theme was “Our World, Our Thriving Future.”, aiming to empower the girls to become active eco-stewards. Indeed, our brownies and girl guides from the schools in the east showcased a myriad of talents – from sports, dance, recycled fashion design to gadgets-making for the environment. 
</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/GGEDD_1.jpg">
<p>“I felt a sense of pride when many of my new friends from other schools praised the school environment, especially our verdant greenery. I also enjoyed holding casual conversations with guides from other schools, understanding how guide sessions are held in their school and learning from them. After this EDD experience, I learnt how to convey my thoughts more effectively, how to work with others and accept their views.” says TKGS guide, Alicia Han (3C3) </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/GGEDD_3.png">
<p>“My team and I took part in the Semaphore Drill performance and got merit! Although there were little hiccups, we overcame them and left with little regrets. More importantly, I learnt an important lesson from this EDD - to BE PREPARED. We had little time to prepare and practise for EDD, leading to some mistakes in our performance and flag party. However, as a leader, I learnt to apply the 7th Guide Law, to HAVE COURAGE and BE CHEERFUL in all difficulties, and also to influence my own guides and cheer them up. Instead of dwelling over past mistakes, we should take action, be prepared, and improve.” says Changkat Changi Secondary School guide, Grace Chew.</p>


<h3><strong>71st Speech and Prize Giving Day</strong></h3>
<p>On 13 April 2024, the school commemorated its 71st Speech and Prize-Giving Day. It was a special occasion that not only celebrated individual excellence in both academic and non-academic areas, but also honoured the school’s collective strength and effort in uplifting our students. </p>

<p>The theme for this year’s International Friendship Day was “Singapore in Asia”, where our school’s celebration took place over several days.

<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/ifd_2.png"></center>
<p>The Glow Up centre was abuzz with various activities designed by our international students who were excited to share about their culture and lives. Students and staff had opportunities to design Batik bookmarks, make a Krathong (water float), tie a Chinese knot and play Japanese games. They also had fun at the photobooth, getting dressed in international costumes and taking pictures with backdrops of key landmarks in Asia. It was a meaningful time for our students of different cultures and background to get to know each other better.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the opportunity to share with others about my country Thailand. It was a great experience to host the booth at the Glow Up Centre,” says Nalinrat Deeratanasrikul (4S5).</p>


<h3><strong>Head Prefect Elections Campaign</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Self Initiated Staff Bonding</strong></h3>
<p>At TKGS, our staff work hard, play harder! Every odd week Friday morning, our staff spends time together for a spot of fun and meaningful activities. These activities are initiated and curated by our very own staff!</p>
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/sibonding_t1_r.png"></center>
<p>Whether it is a balmy walk around the local neighbourhood, sweating it out in a chosen sport, or getting our hands dirty with some craft work, such moments are a must-have for staff to take a breather, recharge and connect with one another.
The casual ambience also allows time for relaxed conversations to be had. Indeed through these self-initiated staff bonding activities, we see the warm and congenial spirit in TKGS which allows for a positive workplace culture in our school. </p>

<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/obs1.png"></center>
Basking under the sun, our TKGians had the valuable opportunity to get close to sand and sea during the 5D4N camp. Various activities helped them get to know students from different schools as they took on the challenge of both land and sea expeditions. The high elements and team building activities imbued a stronger self-belief and the tenacity and adaptability to face ambiguous situations. <br><br>
Our girls came back with many exciting stories to share!  
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/obs_teachstu.jpg"></center>
“OBS gave me the opportunity to establish new friendships with people of different backgrounds, connect with nature, and allowed me to learn and apply values like perseverance and teamwork. I learnt to be grateful for everything I have,” says Victoria Ng (3C3), second from right. 
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/obs_stud_water_.jpg"></center>
“I met some obstacles and even had disagreements with my OBS group mates. But I took them as  learning experiences and chose to persevere,” says Cyneveah Cheang (3I2) centre with two thumbs up. “In the end, I managed to achieve many great things including reaching our final destination after kayaking for 5 hours in open sea waters and under the blazing hot sun!”

<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/tkglow1r.png"></center>
As the first term came to a close, excitement filled the air during our bi-weekly TKGlow! session on 23 February. This session was extra special because it was  put together by The Student Leaders' Network (SLN)! They canvassed ideas from their friends to plan a programme to help classes explore new interests and strengthen their relationships as a class. 
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/tkglow2.png"></center>
Each class had the chance to choose from a variety of activities, ranging from sports to aesthetics. With enthusiasm bubbling over, the student leaders took charge, guiding their classmates through activities like making phone charms, or rose bracelets, balloon sculpting, and even sports like Captains' Ball and Frisbee.<br><br>
The atmosphere was electric as laughter and camaraderie filled every corner of the school grounds. Every activity was a testament to the creativity and teamwork among the students.
