  <h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
</center>
  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
    Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to recollect significant moments 
    that touched them in the year. We call it TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity 
    to express what they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling Moments 
    could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes. They are also cherished memories of school events like Leaders Investiture, and the moment of pride winning a class competition. 
    Or it could be times when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit 
    shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and TK Spirit Week. 
    More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are the simple, ordinary things we do in our 
    daily interactions that touch a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - 
    Little things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people and relationships. 
    May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!

<p>In line with our school theme this year, Luceat Omnibus (‘Courage and Light’) - Shine for All, the ceremony highlighted the importance of pursuing our passions with fortitude and serving others with a heart of humility and gratitude.</p>

In the same vein, our Valedictorian, Belinda Koh, spoke about the leap of faith that she took when she was appointed Vice-Head Prefect and the encouragement that she received in school which helped her to overcome her self-doubts.</p>
<p>“Every moment shared with my friends in TKGS serves as a cherished memory. Although fleeting, these moments were rich with laughter, tears, victories, and challenges, reflecting our growth as individuals. Each memory has imprinted itself upon my heart, shaping the person I am today.” – Belinda Koh, Valedictorian of Class 2023. </p>

<h3><strong>International Friendship Day Celebrations</strong></h3>
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/ifd_1.jpg"></center>
<p>The theme for this year’s International Friendship Day was “Singapore in Asia”, where our school’s celebration took place over several days. We were treated to a medley of ASEAN folks songs during our lunch break, learned fun facts about different cultures and participated in different  hands-on activities. </p>
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/ifd_2.png"></center>
<p>The Glow Up centre was abuzz with various activities designed by our international students who were excited to share about their culture and lives. Students and staff had opportunities to design Batik bookmarks, make a Krathong (water float), tie a Chinese knot and play Japanese games. They also had fun at the photobooth, getting dressed in international costumes and taking pictures with backdrops of key landmarks in Asia. It was a meaningful time for our students of different cultures and background to get to know each other better.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the opportunity to share with others about my country Thailand. It was a great experience to host the booth at the Glow Up Centre,” says Nalinrat Deeratanasrikul (4S5).</p>


<h3><strong>Self Initiated Staff Bonding</strong></h3>
<p>At TKGS, our staff work hard, play harder! Every odd week Friday morning, our staff spends time together for a spot of fun and meaningful activities. These activities are initiated and curated by our very own staff!</p>
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/sibonding_t1_r.png"></center>
<p>Whether it is a balmy walk around the local neighbourhood, sweating it out in a chosen sport, or getting our hands dirty with some craft work, such moments are a must-have for staff to take a breather, recharge and connect with one another.
The casual ambience also allows time for relaxed conversations to be had. Indeed through these self-initiated staff bonding activities, we see the warm and congenial spirit in TKGS which allows for a positive workplace culture in our school. </p>


<h3><strong>Mums@Glow Up!</strong></h3>
On 4 April 2024, our Mums for Life volunteers joined TKGians for the Mums@Glow Up! International Friendship Day celebrations. They made heart-shaped knots with our students which symbolises the love and unity amongst friends and countries. The activity was a meaningful way to have fun, and provide support and encouragement for our students.

“Being a parent volunteer has brought me closer to my daughters, the schoolmates and the school environment,” shares Ms Alaine Poon, parent of Isabella Poon (1R1). “When I see the joy and smiles on their faces, the time and effort we put in is worth it!"

Our Secondary 3 cohort embarked on a significant part of their secondary school education experience in Term One. They participated in the MOE-OBS Camp with students from 3 other schools.
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/obs1.png"></center>
Basking under the sun, our TKGians had the valuable opportunity to get close to sand and sea during the 5D4N camp. Various activities helped them get to know students from different schools as they took on the challenge of both land and sea expeditions. The high elements and team building activities imbued a stronger self-belief and the tenacity and adaptability to face ambiguous situations. <br><br>
Our girls came back with many exciting stories to share!  
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/obs_teachstu.jpg"></center>
“OBS gave me the opportunity to establish new friendships with people of different backgrounds, connect with nature, and allowed me to learn and apply values like perseverance and teamwork. I learnt to be grateful for everything I have,” says Victoria Ng (3C3), second from right. 
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/obs_stud_water_.jpg"></center>
“I met some obstacles and even had disagreements with my OBS group mates. But I took them as  learning experiences and chose to persevere,” says Cyneveah Cheang (3I2) centre with two thumbs up. “In the end, I managed to achieve many great things including reaching our final destination after kayaking for 5 hours in open sea waters and under the blazing hot sun!”

<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/unbox_main_1.jpg"></center>
Our Secondary One students gathered in the school hall for a very special occasion today - the unboxing of their personal learning devices! The hall was filled with a delightful buzz as our students waited patiently in anticipation for their iPads. As part of the ceremony, Ms Chew, our Principal, presented the devices to class representatives - a symbol of the trust bestowed on them to use the device purposefully for their learning in school and beyond the classroom. Students were also briefed on the various accessories that came together with their device and how to best use them.

At the end of the session, our students were excited about the learning possibilities with their iPads. <br><br>
“I’m excited to start taking notes, tackle my SLS assignments, and read online books on my iPad,” shares Eniya Senthilkumar (1I2).


<h3><strong>TKGlow! by Student Leaders' Network</strong></h3>
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/tkglow1.png"></center>
As the first term came to a close, excitement filled the air during our bi-weekly TKGlow! session on 23 February. This session was extra special because it was  put together by The Student Leaders' Network (SLN)! They canvassed ideas from their friends to plan a programme to help classes explore new interests and strengthen their relationships as a class. 
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/tkglow2.png"></center>
Each class had the chance to choose from a variety of activities, ranging from sports to aesthetics. With enthusiasm bubbling over, the student leaders took charge, guiding their classmates through activities like making phone charms, or rose bracelets, balloon sculpting, and even sports like Captains' Ball and Frisbee.<br><br>
The atmosphere was electric as laughter and camaraderie filled every corner of the school grounds. Every activity was a testament to the creativity and teamwork among the students.

<center><a href="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/TDD_cover_pic.jpg"><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/TDD_cover_pic_big.jpg"></a></center>
Our school participated in Singapore’s inaugural Total Defence Exercise. TKGS was one of forty schools selected for the Food Resilience Experience. To simulate food disruption, all canteen stalls were closed on Total Defence Day. Students and staff were only able to eat food packs prepared by Singapore Food Agency for lunch. This experience emphasised the importance of food security, being adaptable and resilient.<br>

<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/TDD_combine.PNG"></center>

Besides the Food Resilience Experience, our students and staff also learned more about how we can contribute to the defence of Singapore through various enriching activities. A big thank you to our uniformed groups and the officers from the Singapore Police Force and Civil Defence Force for sharing your insights with us!

TKGS hosted a Chinese New Year celebration to usher in the year of the
Dragon. We invited parents as well as senior residents from Mountbatten
to join in the festivities.<br><br>
To kick start the celebrations, our students unleashed their creativity
with dragon themed decor for their classrooms. They also put together hampers
for our invited guests. Next, was a reunion class breakfast to enjoy delicious
treats and strengthen bonds with their classmates and teachers.

Following the class activities, we convened in the hall for a concert
brimming with various performances, including calligraphy, martial arts,
acapella by our own students, and a cultural dance performance by the Singapore
Chinese Dance Theatre. An unexpected highlight was the appearance of our
TKGS alumnus - Loh Xuan Yan, Carys of class 2023 who treated us to a medley
of Chinese New Year songs.<br><br>
The celebration ended on a high note, with the gifting of oranges, representing
prosperity and happiness, to our staff, seniors, and parents. It was an
unforgettable event filled with meaningful conversations and gratitude.
