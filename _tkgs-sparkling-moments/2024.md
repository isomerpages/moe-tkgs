Our school participated in Singapore’s inaugural Total Defence Exercise. TKGS was one of forty schools selected for the Food Resilience Experience. To simulate food disruption, all canteen stalls were closed on Total Defence Day. Students and staff were only able to eat food packs prepared by Singapore Food Agency for lunch. This experience emphasised the importance of food security, being adaptable and resilient.<br>

Besides the Food Resilience Experience, our students and staff also learned more about how we can contribute to the defence of Singapore through various enriching activities. A big thank you to our uniformed groups and the officers from the Singapore Police Force and Civil Defence Force for sharing your insights with us!

TKGS hosted a Chinese New Year celebration to usher in the year of the
Dragon. We invited parents as well as senior residents from Mountbatten
to join in the festivities.<br><br>
To kick start the celebrations, our students unleashed their creativity
with dragon themed decor for their classrooms. They also put together hampers
for our invited guests. Next, was a reunion class breakfast to enjoy delicious
treats and strengthen bonds with their classmates and teachers.

Following the class activities, we convened in the hall for a concert
brimming with various performances, including calligraphy, martial arts,
acapella by our own students, and a cultural dance performance by the Singapore
Chinese Dance Theatre. An unexpected highlight was the appearance of our
TKGS alumnus - Loh Xuan Yan, Carys of class 2023 who treated us to a medley
of Chinese New Year songs.<br><br>
The celebration ended on a high note, with the gifting of oranges, representing
prosperity and happiness, to our staff, seniors, and parents. It was an
unforgettable event filled with meaningful conversations and gratitude.
