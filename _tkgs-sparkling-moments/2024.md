  <h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
</center>
  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
    Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to recollect significant moments 
    that touched them in the year. We call it TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity 
    to express what they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling Moments 
    could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes. They are also cherished memories of school events like Leaders Investiture, and the moment of pride winning a class competition. 
    Or it could be times when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit 
    shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and TK Spirit Week. 
    More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are the simple, ordinary things we do in our 
    daily interactions that touch a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - 
    Little things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people and relationships. 
    May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!

<p>To celebrate the opening of the Tanjong Katong MRT Station on the Thomson-East Coast line, students from our school, guided by Mdm Kavitha were invited to design a mural to be displayed at the station. </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/ma_a1.png">
<p>Titled 'Riding the Waves of Change',This artwork portrays Katong’s transformation from a charming Peranakan enclave to a modern urban district, projecting into a dynamic future. Central to this narrative is the now extinct Katong Turtle. It is a symbol of our treasured history and commitment to sustainability as we continue to ride the waves of change. </p>
<p>“In my contribution to the mural, I used watercolour pencils to shade and colour the turtle to make come alive. I also learnt the history of the Tanjong Katong area and how its name came to be.” says student artist Leah Tan (3R1)</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/ma_a2.png">
<p>On 24 June, we  had the honour of presenting the artwork to Mr. Lim Biow Chuan, Advisor to Mountbatten SMC, celebrating our efforts to bring the arts to our community.

<p>The School Administration Team visited the Green Lab Singapore on 3rd June, where we learned about their pioneering efforts in sustainability. We were introduced to Green Lab's mission to become a one-stop provider for sustainable solutions and their latest innovation, the Casaa 180™, a plant-based biodegradable bag. The tour offered us a glimpse into their production line, showcasing how the bags, as well as products such as compostable food-grade containers and even books, were made. The session ended with us making our very own Bioplastic bowl as a souvenir to take home.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/TKSW_CP.jpg">

<p>Our students ended the semester on a high with TKGS Spirit Week! A signature programme for our school, our students participated in a myriad of activities, creating shared memories with their cohort and classes, as they took learning beyond the classroom.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/T2_SW1.png">
<p>This included a visit to the Bird Paradise for the Secondary One students, learning journeys to various institutions as part of the Secondary Two Career Seminar and a Heritage Trail of the TKGS Neighbourhood for the Secondary Three students.</p>

<p>The TKGS Spirit Week was especially memorable for the Secondary Four students. With a focus on self-directed class experiences, C-SPARKS in TKGS allowed the graduating cohort to organise their self-initiated final class activity before graduation. The students had great fun as they came up with creative ideas such as ice-skating lessons at Kallang Ice World and picnics at East Coast Park. </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/T2_SW2.png">
<p>“The high point for me this year was C Sparks where we played at the beach, took photos, sang songs and played volleyball. Everyone was just having fun together,” quipped Nur Erynna Ng (4S5) </p>

<h3><strong> Student Leaders’ Investiture</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/LI24_1.png">
<p>The annual Leaders' Investiture is a cherished event, celebrating the honour bestowed upon our student leaders to lead and serve the school community. During the investiture, we meaningfully invested our Sec 3 Student Leaders into the four leadership boards: Class Committee, CCA Leaders, House Committee, and the Prefectorial Board. 
	<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/LI24_2.png">	
This was done whilst formally recognizing the contributions and legacy of our Sec 4 Student Leaders. The heads of each board took to the stage to introduce their members, express gratitude to the Sec 4 leaders, and warmly welcome the new Sec 3 leaders.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/LI24_3.png">
<p>This year, we had the privilege of having Dr Tan Lai Yong to grace the occasion as our guest speaker. Dr Tan captivated the audience with inspiring stories from his life in Yunnan, China, sharing invaluable lessons on resilience, community service and leadership. His words left a profound impact on both the student leaders and the school community.</p>
<p>The ceremony culminated with all leaders taking the Leaders' Creed, pledging their commitment to uphold the values and responsibilities of their roles. It was a moment of pride and promise for the future.</p>

<h3><strong>Hari Raya and Tamil New Year Celebration</strong></h3>
<p>On April 26th, our school came together to celebrate Hari Raya and the Tamil New Year. The celebrations kickstarted with a Hari Raya performance by Wira Budaya. The lively skit provided insights into the global celebrations of Ramadan and Hari Raya. It then culminated in a spirited dance performance to the tune of Alamak Raya Lagi, where our students and staff jumped at the chance to join the performers on stage. The atmosphere was electric with shouts of encouragement as they gamely danced to the beat.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/HRTNY_1.png">
<p>“The skit helped me to better understand what my peers go through during Ramadan and Hari Raya and I gained a new appreciation of Malay food and culture.” says Dayna Maha (3H4).</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/HRTNY_2.png">
<p>Next, AKT Creations took to the stage to share more about how the Tamil New Year is celebrated. They presented a  rich and colourful medley of Tamil traditional art forms which included the Mayilattam (peacock dance) and Puravi Attam (horse dance). The performances were accompanied with live music played on the traditional Mathalam drum. “The concert was very fun! I loved it when the teachers were called on stage to try out dancing as a horse!” shares Sana Raghuraman (1I2). </p>


<h3><strong>Girl Guides East Division Day</strong></h3>
<p>On 26 April 2024, TKGS played host to Brownies and Guides from 35 secondary and primary schools in commemoration of the Girl Guides East Division Day (EDD). It was an honour to serve the Girl Guides community in providing a space to promote leadership, service and personal development growth.  This year’s theme was “Our World, Our Thriving Future.”, aiming to empower the girls to become active eco-stewards. Indeed, our brownies and girl guides from the schools in the east showcased a myriad of talents – from sports, dance, recycled fashion design to gadgets-making for the environment. 
</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/GGEDD_1.jpg">
<p>“I felt a sense of pride when many of my new friends from other schools praised the school environment, especially our verdant greenery. I also enjoyed holding casual conversations with guides from other schools, understanding how guide sessions are held in their school and learning from them. After this EDD experience, I learnt how to convey my thoughts more effectively, how to work with others and accept their views.” says TKGS guide, Alicia Han (3C3) </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/GGEDD_3.png">
<p>“My team and I took part in the Semaphore Drill performance and got merit! Although there were little hiccups, we overcame them and left with little regrets. More importantly, I learnt an important lesson from this EDD - to BE PREPARED. We had little time to prepare and practise for EDD, leading to some mistakes in our performance and flag party. However, as a leader, I learnt to apply the 7th Guide Law, to HAVE COURAGE and BE CHEERFUL in all difficulties, and also to influence my own guides and cheer them up. Instead of dwelling over past mistakes, we should take action, be prepared, and improve.” says Changkat Changi Secondary School guide, Grace Chew.</p>


<h3><strong>71st Speech and Prize Giving Day</strong></h3>
<p>On 13 April 2024, the school commemorated its 71st Speech and Prize-Giving Day. It was a special occasion that not only celebrated individual excellence in both academic and non-academic areas, but also honoured the school’s collective strength and effort in uplifting our students. </p>

Although fleeting, these moments were rich with laughter, tears, victories, and challenges, reflecting our growth as individuals. Each memory has imprinted itself upon my heart, shaping the person I am today.” – Belinda Koh, Valedictorian of Class 2023. </p>

It was a meaningful time for our students of different cultures and background to get to know each other better.</p>

<h3><strong>Self Initiated Staff Bonding</strong></h3>

<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/sibonding_t1_r.png"></center>
<p>Whether it is a balmy walk around the local neighbourhood, sweating it out in a chosen sport, or getting our hands dirty with some craft work, such moments are a must-have for staff to take a breather, recharge and connect with one another.
The casual ambience also allows time for relaxed conversations to be had. Indeed through these self-initiated staff bonding activities, we see the warm and congenial spirit in TKGS which allows for a positive workplace culture in our school. </p>

<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/obs1.png"></center>
Basking under the sun, our TKGians had the valuable opportunity to get close to sand and sea during the 5D4N camp. Various activities helped them get to know students from different schools as they took on the challenge of both land and sea expeditions. The high elements and team building activities imbued a stronger self-belief and the tenacity and adaptability to face ambiguous situations. <br><br>
Our girls came back with many exciting stories to share!  
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/obs_teachstu.jpg"></center>
“OBS gave me the opportunity to establish new friendships with people of different backgrounds, connect with nature, and allowed me to learn and apply values like perseverance and teamwork. I learnt to be grateful for everything I have,” says Victoria Ng (3C3), second from right. 
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/obs_stud_water_.jpg"></center>
“I met some obstacles and even had disagreements with my OBS group mates. But I took them as  learning experiences and chose to persevere,” says Cyneveah Cheang (3I2) centre with two thumbs up. “In the end, I managed to achieve many great things including reaching our final destination after kayaking for 5 hours in open sea waters and under the blazing hot sun!”

The hall was filled with a delightful buzz as our students waited patiently in anticipation for their iPads. As part of the ceremony, Ms Chew, our Principal, presented the devices to class representatives - a symbol of the trust bestowed on them to use the device purposefully for their learning in school and beyond the classroom. Students were also briefed on the various accessories that came together with their device and how to best use them.

<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/tkglow1.png"></center>
As the first term came to a close, excitement filled the air during our bi-weekly TKGlow! session on 23 February. This session was extra special because it was  put together by The Student Leaders' Network (SLN)! They canvassed ideas from their friends to plan a programme to help classes explore new interests and strengthen their relationships as a class. 
<center><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2024/tkglow2.png"></center>
Each class had the chance to choose from a variety of activities, ranging from sports to aesthetics. With enthusiasm bubbling over, the student leaders took charge, guiding their classmates through activities like making phone charms, or rose bracelets, balloon sculpting, and even sports like Captains' Ball and Frisbee.<br><br>
The atmosphere was electric as laughter and camaraderie filled every corner of the school grounds. Every activity was a testament to the creativity and teamwork among the students.
