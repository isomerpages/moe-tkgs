  <h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
</center>
  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
    Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to recollect significant moments 
    that touched them in the year. We call it TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity 
    to express what they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling Moments 
    could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes. They are also cherished memories of school events like Leaders Investiture, and the moment of pride winning a class competition. 
    Or it could be times when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit 
    shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and TK Spirit Week. 
    More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are the simple, ordinary things we do in our 
    daily interactions that touch a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - 
    Little things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people and relationships. 
    May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!

<h3><strong>Innofest</strong></h3>

<p>Innofest 2025, our annual learning festival for staff, was a resounding success! Themed "Empowering Learners, Every Way 2.0," the event brought our teachers together to share best practices and discover innovative teaching methods.</p>

<p>Throughout the festival, teachers explored various strategies to make learning more interactive and engaging for all students. They learned how to nurture curiosity, encourage critical thinking, and foster a love of learning in their students.</p>

<p>One highlight of Innofest was also the opening of two subject homerooms by the Mother Tongue Language and Humanities department. These rooms served as inspiring examples for our teachers, as they got to observe firsthand how thoughtful spatial design can create a more positive learning experience for students. </p>

<p>The valuable insights gleaned from the different projects will undoubtedly benefit all of our students in the years to come.</p>
