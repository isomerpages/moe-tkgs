<h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
<p>Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to
recollect significant moments that touched them in the year. We call it
TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity to express what
they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling
Moments could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes.
They are also cherished memories of school events like Leaders Investiture,
and the moment of pride winning a class competition. Or it could be times
when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit
shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and
TK Spirit Week. More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are
the simple, ordinary things we do in our daily interactions that touch
a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - Little
things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people
and relationships. May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!</p>


<h3><strong>Celebrating our TKGS Alumni</strong></h3>
<p>From time to time, our school receives news of how our students are doing in their post-secondary endeavours. It fills us with joy, knowing that they are doing well beyond the walls of TKGS and that we have played a part in their scholastic journey.</p>

<h3><strong>Our China Immersion Trip: Experiencing Heritage and Culture Firsthand</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/CNIM25_Hero.png">
<p>Following the conclusion of the school year, we embarked on a Cultural Immersion Trip to China, where we explored the distinctive environments and rich heritage of Chongqing and Xi'an.</p>

<p>In Chongqing, we visited the Tian Run Food Industry, where we made soya bean curd from scratch, and the Chongqing Science and Technology Museum, where we engaged in hands-on scientific experiments. We also explored the breathtaking Wulong Karst landscape, marvelling at its natural geological formations.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/CNIM25_1.png">

<p>“What impressed me the most was the scenery and how geographical processes such as the movement of tectonic plates had led to the formation. The different trails were all unique in their own ways, with different names for different bridges, each with their own rich history,” says Esther John (3H4).</p>

<p>Next, we visited Xi'an where we learned about the city's ancient heritage through visits to iconic cultural sites such as the Great Mosque and the world-renowned Terracotta Army. At the Great Mosque, we witnessed the unique blend of Chinese and Islamic architectural styles. The visit to the Terracotta Army also allowed us to gain insights into China's imperial history and the remarkable craftsmanship of ancient Chinese artisans.</p>

<p>“Visiting the Terracotta Army was an eye-opening experience that helped me appreciate the scale and sophistication of ancient Chinese civilization. It taught me not just about ancient China’s prowess but also about the human effort and artistry behind one of history’s most remarkable achievements,” says Tessa Lin (3S5).</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/CNIM25_2.png">
<p>One of the most memorable experiences was the school immersion programme at Xi'an Gaoxin No.1 Middle School, where we participated in both academic lessons and co-curricular activities with our Chinese friends. During the Wushu sessions, we learnt traditional martial arts together, sharing laughter over our mistakes while constantly encouraging one another. These meaningful interactions and shared experiences transformed their trip into a truly unforgettable cultural exchange.</p>

<p>“Stepping into a new school culture allowed me to discover how adaptable and open-minded I can be even when placed in an unfamiliar environment. The experience also taught me the importance of cultural sensitivity. It taught me that understanding others begins with listening and observing others with respect,” shares Kayle Lee (3R6).</p>

<p>All in all, the shared experiences in this cultural immersion trip have fostered adaptability, curiosity, and lasting bonds, transforming our educational concepts into unforgettable personal memories.</p>

<h3><strong>TK Spirit Week: A Celebration of Learning and Community</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/25T4SW_Hero.png">
<p>The week kicked off with a show of gratitude towards our support staff—our heroes behind the scenes. These dedicated individuals work tirelessly to keep our school running smoothly, and to recognize their invaluable contributions, our student leaders presented them with specially designed tote bags and filled them with thoughtful goodies.</p>
<p>Next, our students ventured out of their classrooms to discover new passions, forge stronger bonds, and connect with the world outside the classroom walls. </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/25T4SW_1.png">
<p>Highlighting some of the key programmes, our Secondary One students continued to build on their class spirit with Cohort Games and applied their logical and critical thinking to solving real world problems in the Math Explorer programme. Our Secondary Two students focussed on resilience and teamwork at their Outdoor Adventure camp in Jalan Bhatera. Not to be left out, our Secondary Three students learned more about the people and culture of our neighbourhood in the Heritage Trail and designed and built sandcastles together as a class. </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/25T4SW_2.png">
<br>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/25T4SW_3.png">
<p>The week rounded off with our class breakfast at the circular block lawn as well as our school’s mass dance. These experiences were certainly vital lessons in critical thinking, creativity and deep connection. What a great way to end 2025!</p>


<h3><strong>2025 Semester Two Highlights</strong></h3>
<p>As the final bell rings on another amazing school year, let's take a moment to look back at the connections we've made and our experiences.</p>

<p>This year-end video is a heartfelt thank you to every student who brightened a hallway, every teacher who inspired a mind, and every staff member who made our school run smoothly. It’s a celebration of the small gestures and big milestones that shaped our journey.</p>

<p>See the smiles, relive the triumphs, and recognize the immense value of our community. Because when we pause to appreciate everything—the challenges that taught us and the successes that lifted us—we realize just how truly fortunate we are.</p>

<p>Thank you for making this year unforgettable. Hit play and let the gratitude flow!</p>

<h3><strong>Honouring the Ones who Guide us: Teachers’ Day 2025</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/TD25_Hero.png">
<p>September 4th was all about celebrating the incredible dedication, passion, and hard work of our very own TkChers. But our teachers do so much more than just teach! They guide us, inspire our curiosity, and ignite a lifelong love for learning.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/TD25_1.png">
<p>What's better than a day dedicated to celebrating our incredible teachers? A Teachers’ Day filled with food, fun, and heartfelt appreciation! The day kicked off with a delightful breakfast where students prepared a simple breakfast of sorts for their form teachers, turning the classroom into a cosy, joyful space. It was the perfect warm-up for the main event—the highly anticipated Teachers’ Day concert!</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/TD25_2.png">
<p>The energy was absolutely electric as students cheered on their teachers during the walk-in section. The concert stage came alive with a dynamic mix of games, hilarious skits performed by our talented Drama Club members, as well as touching performances, all dedicated to our amazing TkChers. There were also some games that allowed students to see a different side of their teachers. Sophie Teo (2H4) shared, “I learned more about my teachers through the games and videos. Seeing their childhood photos made me realise they were once just like me!” </p>

<p>Post-concert, the day was bursting with genuine gratitude as students lined up excitedly outside the staff room, eager to personally thank their teachers and hand over their thoughtful gifts. Vera Teo (3I2) perfectly summed it up, "Teachers' Day gives us a chance to truly show our appreciation for everything our teachers have done for us."</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/TD25_3.png">
<p>Next, our TKGS staff gathered at the Concorde Hotel for a sky-high celebration themed “Take Flight - because we lift lives every day.” From the moment teachers “checked in” with their boarding passes, the ballroom buzzed with an airport-terminal atmosphere, complete with travel music plus bustling photo and gift-tag booths. Indeed the “in-flight entertainment” such as Airport Charades, Inflight Snack Dash and Paper Plane Precision filled the room with laughter and friendly rivalry.</p>

<p>This year’s Teachers’ Day festivities from our students, School Advisory Committee, Alumni and Parentlink truly recognised the hard and heart work of our teachers as they help every student take flight. Happy Teachers’ Day!</p>

<h3><strong>TKGS Paints the School Red (and White!)</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/NDP_Hero.png">
<p>On August 8, TKGians gathered for the school's annual National Day celebrations, transforming the campus into a sea of vibrant red and white! The day began with a solemn yet spirited parade led by the uniformed groups, followed by the entire school singing the national anthem in one united voice.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/NDP_1.png">
<p>It was then time for the cohort-based activities. Excitement buzzed in the classrooms, especially for the Secondary 3s who finally received their long-awaited ICs. “Receiving my IC was a milestone for me. It made me feel one step closer to stepping out into society, as I develop myself even more as a person,” shared Isabelle Tan (3R1).</p> 

<p>Secondary 2 students tried their hands at making Chinese knots, a traditional craft symbolising unity and good luck, while the Secondary 1s created artworks and videos celebrating Singapore’s multicultural heritage. “I thoroughly enjoyed this activity, as I got to learn more about my classmates’ cultures,” said Cynthia (1S5). Our graduating cohort also put their creativity to the test by creating an artefact that captured their aspirations for Singapore!</p>

<p>To round up the classroom activities, Form Teachers gave out the National Day souvenir which came in the form of a red bucket hat designed by our fellow TKGian, Marisa Leong (2S5), adding to the festive cheer.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/NDP_2.png">
<p>The celebrations continued in the school hall in the form of a dazzling concert, featuring musical performances, a trivia quiz, and this year’s National Day song, “Here We Are,” led by the House Leaders. Seniors from the Mountbatten Activity Centre were also invited to join the festivities, singing alongside students. “Seeing students, teachers and our senior guests come together to celebrate the nation’s birthday felt really nice, like we are one big family,” reflected Raeann Loke (3H4)</p>

<p>The celebration was more than just a festive occasion—it was a heartfelt reminder of what it means to be Singaporean. As TKGians stood side by side, united in song, laughter, and shared experiences, the day highlighted not only the pride in our nation’s 60th birthday but also the enduring spirit of unity and resilience that defines the TKGS community.</p>

<h3><strong>Many Races, One Heart: Celebrating Racial Harmony Day in TKGS</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/rhd_hero.png">

<p>The school burst into a kaleidoscope of colours on Friday, 25 July 2025, as TKGS commemorated Singapore’s annual Racial Harmony Day. Students wore a vibrant array of traditional costumes, showcasing Singapore's rich diversity. They donned baju kurungs, cheongsams, and lehengas, representing the country's main racial groups. The celebration of culture went even further, with students also arriving in traditional dress from their home countries of Japan, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>

<p>In an effort to capture the moment, classes took part in a friendly competition to snap the most creative class photograph. Class spirits ran high, and some classes went all out—even roping in our school leaders for bonus points!</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/RHD_1.png">

<p>Meanwhile, during TKGlow periods, each level explored a different hands-on craft. Secondary One students learned how to draw intricate Kalam patterns, while Secondary Two students made traditional Chinese knots. Our upper secondary students crafted rattan coasters, representing strength, resilience, and unity. These experiences give us an opportunity to “celebrate all the differences between races as a nation and learn new things about each other,” said Nurun Nuha (2G7).</p>

<p>The event's legacy lessons brought students closer together. They shared meaningful aspects of their heritage, explaining why traditions mattered and the values they represented.</p>

<p>The festivities culminated in a vibrant lunchtime concert, filling the canteen with energy and cheers. Musicians from different races came together to play instruments from various traditions. “It was interesting because I got to learn about their different cultures and traditions!” shared Erica Lee (2G7).</p>

<p>The day ended on a meaningful note—reminding us that unity in diversity is what makes Singapore strong.</p>

<h3><strong>Four Houses, One Family, Celebrating Unity at TKGS Sports Carnival</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SC25_1.png">
<p>4 July 2025, Friday, marked the highly anticipated TKGS Sports Carnival, held at Singapore Polytechnic. TKGians arrived in vibrant house t-shirts, joined by enthusiastic staff members donning their respective house colours with pride. For the first time, non-teaching staff also participated in the festivities, making the occasion truly inclusive and memorable.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SC25_2.png">
<p>Unlike previous years, the day began with inter-house games and the exciting Human Foosball event. The atmosphere buzzed with energy as spectators roared with cheers and players gave their all. Perseverance and team spirit were evident in every match, as students fought passionately for house glory. Yet, beyond the competitive spirit, what stood out most was the exemplary sportsmanship displayed—on and off the field.</p>
<p>“I could see the sportsmanship between houses. TKGians helped members from the opposing team when they fell and cheered the players on, regardless of House!” shares Arissa Winata (2I2)
Indeed, the Sports Carnival is not merely about winning—it is about sisterhood and unity, celebrating the strength of our TKGS family.</p>
<p>“I felt proud of (my house) Halimah each time we placed. Even though I didn’t participate in any events, I saw my friends participating and had fun cheering for them,” says Alisara Suksuwan (1I2). </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SC25_3.png">
<p>A highlight of the day was the thrilling 50m relay event, where Principal Ms Chew joined Halimah House in the race. Her participation sparked a stadium-wide cheer, showing the deep camaraderie shared across all levels of the school.
To celebrate Youth Day, students were also surprised with a refreshing ice cream treat—an energising reward after an exciting day of games and sunshine. The air was filled with laughter and chatter, as students gathered in celebration and cool relief.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SC25_4.png">
<p>The event concluded on a high with Teresa House taking home the overall championship for the third consecutive year—an incredible testament to their enduring spirit and teamwork.
More than just a competition, Sports Carnival 2025 was a reminder of the vibrant community, sportsmanship, and sisterhood that define the TKGS experience.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Batam Experience: A Journey of Discovery and Learning</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/VIABT25_Hero.jpg">
<p>During the June Holidays, we were grateful for the opportunity to participate in the Overseas Batam Trip. We visited the Batam Museum and learned interesting facts about Batam.

Through the enriching industrial visits to the Singapore Consulate-General in Batam, Infinite Studios and Integrated Engineering Group, we broadened our perspectives and learned that Batam is important in the development of Singapore.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/VIABT25_1.png">
<p>The highlight of the trip for me was the interaction with the orphans at Berkat Bengsa. Despite the language barrier, we shared simple English and had fun them through art and craft activities, games,  music and dance and made new friends. We also forged unforgettable memories with our peers at TKGS.

I really admire the teenagers in terms of their mindset towards life. Despite coming from less fortunate backgrounds, they are happy and positive and make the best use of their resources, opportunities and talents. I learnt to step out of my comfort zone during ViA projects. </p>

<h3><strong>2025 Semester One Highlights</strong></h3>
<p>As another incredible semester draws to a close, we're thrilled to present a video celebrating the vibrant spirit of our school! </p>

<h3><strong>TK Spirit Week: Unleashing the TKGS Explorer</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SPW_1.png">
<p>TK Spirit Week was a dynamic adventure that propelled our students beyond the typical lessons in school. Our Secondary One students explored the Arts at a Singapore Symphony Orchestra performance and a theatre staging of their Literature text. They also got to work in groups on an inter-displinary project at Bird Paradise. The Secondary Two cohort turned nature into their "personal playground" as they explored Flora and Fauna on an Eco-Discovery Hike and went on learning journeys to different industries.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SPW_2.png">
<p>Camp Haven was the highlight for our Secondary Three students who tackled a "wild jungle gym of teamwork" at camp, deepening their sense of resilience in uncertain situations.</p>
<p>“Our legs were aching, but we made sure that no one was left behind. We encouraged the ones who were slower, celebrated the ones who led, and by the end, we crossed the finish line as one class, ” Karis Sing (3R6) reflects on her experience on the 12km hike at the Southern Ridges</p>
<p>Not forgetting our Secondary Four cohort  who got a "total brain reset" from their studies with C-Sparks activities, where classes planned a fun-filled class activity to rest and recharge. </p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SPW_3.png">
<p>Amidst the shared laughter and experiences, this vibrant week was more than just about having fun, but creating space to build much needed soft skills and lasting friendships for the future.</p>


<h3><strong>Leading with Heart: Celebrating Our Student Leaders</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/LI25_1.png">
<p>The Leaders' Investiture on 14 May wasn't just an event; it was a deeply meaningful moment where we honoured the incredible commitment of our Class, CCA, House leaders as well as Prefects. It was a day that to truly celebrate those who have bravely stepped forward, ready to serve their peers, school, and the wider community with purpose and passion.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/LI25_2.png">
<p>We were honoured to have as our Guest-of-Honour, Mrs Jennifer Yeo, Founder and Chairperson of the VIVA Foundation for Children with Cancer. Mrs Yeo delivered an inspiring address, sharing her personal journey and what compelled her to start the VIVA Foundation. Her heartfelt message about hope, love and purpose left a deep impression on our students. It was a truly uplifting event that set a strong tone for purpose-driven leadership and service with love.</p>
<p>This ceremony marked the start of a leadership journey, one built on the foundations of purpose, courage, and selfless service. More than simply a formal appointment, the Investiture was a heartfelt call to action – a powerful affirmation of our unwavering belief that every single student leader possesses the ability to ignite positive change. We trust in their capacity to lead not just with integrity, but with profound empathy and heart.</p>
<p>As Ashni D/O Kanagarajan Solagar, our Head Prefect for 2025/26, shared, “the investiture was such a proud and exciting moment—it really made everything feel real. Standing there with my fellow leaders, I felt honored and ready to take on the responsibility with confidence and heart." Her words truly captured the spirit of this significant occasion.</p>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/LI25_3.png">
<p>As these new student leaders take on their new roles, we are reminded that leadership is not about titles, but about the daily choices to uplift others, to persevere in the face of challenges, and to lead by example. Congratulations to our student leaders!</p>


<h3><strong>A Parent's Affirmation: A nod to our TKGS Journey</strong></h3>
We are delighted to share a heartfelt affirmation from Mdm Loong Shih Huey, mother of recent graduate Julia Chia Xiu-en (4R1, 2024). Receiving such encouraging words truly warms our hearts and reinforces the strong partnership we deeply value between home and school. Mdm Loong's kind reflections (appended below) on Julia's positive and enriching experience at TKGS underscore our commitment to fostering a supportive environment where every student can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. Her appreciation for our dedicated teachers, caring staff, engaging activities, and the school's nurturing culture highlights the rich tapestry of experiences we strive to create for each and every TKGS girl.<br><br>

<h3><strong>72nd Speech &amp; Prize Giving Ceremony</strong></h3>
<p>The 72nd Speech &amp; Prize Giving Ceremony was more than a celebration—it was a shining tribute to the courage, determination, and resilience of our students, perfectly capturing the spirit of this year’s theme, Aurora Odyssey – Dawn of a New Adventure.</p>

<p>During the week-long celebration leading up to the main event, various TKGS staff members and Secondary 1 to 3 students received their awards during the morning assembly. The student recipients were proudly joined by their parents in front of the school.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SD25_1.png">

<p>On 12 April, the celebration culminated in a special ceremony that brought the school community together in a spirit of pride and inspiration. Our Guest of Honour, Dr. Shen Yiru, founder and Chief Executive Officer of The Gentle Group, urged our students to embrace the courage to make changes, follow their passion, and remember that grades do not define us. A scientist by training with a distinguished career in the sciences, Dr. Shen made a bold choice in 2019 to leave the stability of her role at A-Star and pursue a greater purpose. Fueled by hope and a deep commitment to improving patients’ lives, she founded Gentle Group, a social enterprise focused on providing pureed meals and specialised care for individuals with swallowing difficulties. Her journey is a powerful reminder of the importance of hope, discovery, and determination, even when faced with the challenges of forging an unconventional path.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SD25_2b.png">
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SD25_3a.png">

<p>In the same spirit, our Valedictorian, Loh Si Ling, spoke passionately about how stepping out of her comfort zone to serve as her class Chairperson opened doors to unexpected opportunities and helped her develop her leadership skills, ultimately leading to her appointment as the school’s Head Prefect.<br>“…the smallest actions can have the biggest impact… when you take risks and embrace challenges, you open the door to growth in ways you never imagined… be bold, and dare start your own adventure.” – Loh Si Ling, Valedictorian of Class 2024.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SD25_4.png">

<p>As the day progressed, the ceremony celebrated achievements across various fields, demonstrating that we all have the potential to shine in different areas. This message was joyfully.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SD25_5.png">

<p>The 72nd Speech &amp; Prize Giving Ceremony was a testament to the diverse talents and achievements of our students. As they continue their journeys, we have faith that they will carry with them the lessons learned in TKGS, ready to explore new horizons and seize the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/SD25_6.png">


<h3><strong>Celebrating Cultures, Building Bridges</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/IFD_Hero.png">

<p>The air crackled with excitement and the vibrant hues of tradition as our school community came together for a truly unforgettable International Friendship Day (IFD) celebration on 8 April!  Through the morning assembly sharings, students gained a deeper understanding of the experiences and rich culture of their international friends from Vietnam, Indonesia, India and China. </p>
<p>The canteen buzzed with engaging booths where enthusiastic students explored global cultures. They joyfully played traditional games, savored local snacks, donned national costumes, and crafted intricate items. </p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/IFD_1.png">

<p>“It was heartening to see our efforts being appreciated and our culture being embraced by others. I was also able to reconnect with my own cultural roots as I researched on my Indonesian tradition and history,” shares Audrey Lesmana (4S5).  “The experience also helped to broaden my perspective and deepen my appreciation for the cultural diversity in Singapore.”</p>
<p>Indeed our school community fostered a stronger sense of belonging and built vibrant connections across cultures, encouraging openness and celebrating our diverse community.</p>

<h3><strong>Celebrating Class Culture: Annual Class Noticeboard Competition</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/NOB_Hero.png">

<p>A cherished annual tradition at Tanjong Katong Girls' School, the Class Noticeboard Competition was an enriching activity that gave our students complete freedom to decorate their class notice boards as creatively as they wished - the only limit is their imagination. </p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/NOB_1.png">

<p>Students collaborated to design their noticeboards, visually representing their class values. The lower secondary classes even had a chance to design door wraps, and banners to complement their noticeboards.  This creative process strengthened bonds and showcased each class's unique identity.
</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/NOB_2.png">

<p>On the day of the notice board presentations, cheers and applause reverberated throughout the school hall. Proud smiles plastered across each student’s face as they watched their peers explain their class motto and theme on stage. Further adding to the invigorating nature of the Class Noticeboard Competition, some classes ended with a splash, performing their very own class cheer! “Being a presenter was extremely fun and rewarding as it was an opportunity to represent my class,” shares Rachel Chua Rui Xuan (2R1).</p>

<p>Proudly organised by our student leaders from the Class Committee Exco, this event not only brought out our students’ creativity but also fostered teamwork, pride, and a sense of belonging within their classes, setting the tone for the year ahead.</p>

<p>TKGians are certainly artists too - we gave them paintbrushes, and they traced vibrant strokes of resonance.</p>

<h3><strong>A Musical Journey: TKGS Choir at the Esplanade Concert Hall</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/LL_Hero.png">

<p>On 12 March, our TKGS Choir took to the Esplanade Concert Hall stage for Limelight, presenting an enchanting evening filled with a captivating blend of music. </p>
	
<p>From the first rehearsal to the final bow, Limelight was more than just a concert—it was a testament to our dedication, resilience, and teamwork. Every note we sang carried the weight of months of intense rehearsals, late-night self practices, and moments of self-doubt. Yet, through every challenge, we grew—not just as singers, but as a united choir.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/LL_1.png">

<p>This journey taught us the power of perseverance, the beauty of music, and the strength found in trust and collaboration. Choir is not just about individual talent but about blending voices to create something greater than ourselves. As the last note faded and applause filled the hall, we knew that every challenge had been worth it.  In the words of Kim Yuna (3R1), we are "grateful for this opportunity to perform together with such amazing fellow choristers".</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/LL_2.png">

<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Esplanade for hosting us, our dedicated teachers-in-charge, Ms Tong and Mdm Li, and our inspiring conductors, Ms Lim and Ms Chai. Your unwavering support and guidance, as well as the encouraging audience, made this evening memorable!</p>

<h3><strong>Discovering Punggol's Waters: A Singapore World Water Day Learning Trail</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/PUB_Hero.png">

<p>To commemorate Singapore World Water Day, my class (2G7) and students from Geylang Methodist School (Primary) worked hand in hand to conceptualise and facilitate a learning trail at Punggol Waterway. The trail was specially prepared for Valour Primary School students so that they could learn more about the water design features in Punggol Waterway through fun and engaging activities.</p>

<p>During the planning phase, we had the privilege of being mentored by seniors from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, as we spent months brainstorming together and designing the learning trail. On 13 March, which was the day of the trail, students from both TKGS and GMS(P) shared enthusiastically about the water cycle and water sustainability with our guests from Valour Primary School. </p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/PUB_1.png">

<p>“Thank you for inviting us to the learning trail. Our students had a great time and learned a lot from the session,” shared Valour Primary School Outdoor Club Teacher, Ms Chua.</p>

<p>I was really pleased by the result of all our hard work. Designing booths outside of curriculum time was difficult but we managed to apply what we learned in Science and Geography in a way that would appeal to younger students. </p>

<p>It was rewarding to see the smiles of the Valour Primary School students. Through raising awareness on water sustainability issues, the class learned that we can make a difference in simple ways.</p>

<p>On February 28, students had the opportunity to enjoy fun-filled activities
galore with their classmates during TKGlow. This event was organised by
our very own Student Leaders Network (SLN), where classes got to choose
their preferred activity to explore together with their classmates.</p>
<p>Students’ creativity shone through their DIY crafts, from loom bracelets

creativity, as students poured their hearts into crafting unique masterpieces.
The air crackled with laughter and shared determination, a vibrant testament
to the unbreakable bonds forged between classmates.</p>
<p>On the athletic front, classes also took part in various sports. Despite
the activities’ competitive nature, students unwaveringly supported each
other, cheering their peers' names and sharing high-fives.</p>
<p>Guided by our student leaders, TKGlow was indeed a day of discovery, revealing
hidden interests and building vibrant friendships through shared activities
and laughter.</p>

</div>
<p>This Total Defence Day, themed "Together We Keep Singapore Strong," buzzed
with activity as students and staff immersed themselves in a series of
engaging experiences. A unique start to the day saw the canteen closed,
prompting everyone to share food packs provided by the Singapore Food Agency.
This shared meal fostered camaraderie while illustrating the potential
impact of food disruptions.</p>

<p>Another highlight for many was the chance to explore the Singapore Police
Force's Next-Generation Fast Response Car. Students peppered officers with
questions, eager to learn about its high-tech features and vital role in
keeping Singapore safe. Equally valuable were the life-saving skills taught
by NCDCC cadets from Yuan Ching Secondary School and Northlight School.
From confidently operating a fire extinguisher to practicing CPR, students
embraced the training with enthusiasm, preparing themselves to respond
effectively in emergencies.</p>

<p>The commemoration also featured a crucial emergency evacuation exercise
to an external site at Tanjong Katong Primary School. Students and staff
responded swiftly and calmly to the evacuation call, demonstrating the
school's readiness to handle real-world emergencies.</p>
<p>“I found the Total Defence Day celebrations fun and meaningful. I experienced
what it would be like during times of crisis and how to prepare for it,”
Renee Tan (3R1)</p>
<p>Indeed, the day was well spent not only imparting valuable skills but
also deepening our school’s understanding of Total Defence. It served as
a powerful reminder: we all play a critical role in keeping Singapore strong,
together.</p>

<p>On January 28, 2025, Tanjong Katong Girls’ School came alive with festive
cheer as students celebrated the Year of the Snake with a day brimming

<p>The celebration began with a delightful class breakfast, where students
bonded over festive treats, laughter, and heartfelt well-wishes. In the
school hall, the concert opened with a live calligraphy demonstration which
I had the pleasure of showcasing, accompanied by the harmonious melodies
of the String Ensemble.</p>
<p>This was closely followed by the lion and dragon dance performances. The
lively and agile movements of the performers symbolised luck and prosperity,

<p>The performances continued to captivate, with the thunderous beats of
the Festive Drums that reverberated throughout the hall, energizing the
audience with their rhythmic precision. Our Dance Club then took to the

leaving the audience in awe of their skill and coordination. The celebration
reached its peak when our teachers and schoolmates delighted us with their
own rendition of several classic Chinese New Year songs.</p>
<p>Our celebration concluded memorably with the gifting of oranges, a symbol
of prosperity and happiness, to our staff, parents, and our invited guests
from Mountbatten.</p>
<p>“It was a day of togetherness, laughter, and cultural appreciation that
would be remembered for years to come.” Emily Prajogo (4R6) shared, capturing

<p>Roars of excitement echoed through the halls of Tanjong Katong Girls'
School as our Secondary One to Four students plunged headfirst into their
Cohort Experience, kickstarting a brand new year. This vibrant celebration
of school spirit wasn't just about fun and games; it was also a testament

</div>
<p>From adrenaline-pumping dragon boat races to the serenity of cycling along
the East Coast Park, these various activities provided many opportunities
for our TKGians to connect with their peers and teachers, all while learning
more about the school’s values and culture.</p>
<p>We find out from our student what the experience was like for them:</p>
<p>‘My Orientation Group Leaders were incredible! They were so enthusiastic
and supportive. Singing the school song together created such a strong
sense of belonging. I loved the entire Cohort Experience, especially campfire
night!’ shares Candyse Tay (1R1)</p>
<p>‘I got to know classmates that I previously did not know that well, strengthening
our class spirit as we had fun together,’ shares Aafsheen Ibrahim (2C3)</p>
<p>‘The cohort experience was truly one-of-a-kind! The exciting cycling expedition
pushed me beyond my comfort zone, allowing me to challenge myself and reach
new heights as I embarked on an incredible adventure with my new class,’

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/CC_2.png">
</div>
<p>‘Activities such as dragon boating and bouldering gave me a rare opportunity
to step out of school to spend time having fun with my friends. The ECG
workshops and learning journeys to Lifelong Learning Institute and Ngee
Ann Polytechnic also helped me discover my strengths and interests and
explore post-Secondary options,’ shares Jernice Lee (4I2).</p>
<p>‘Leading the Sec Ones during Cohort experience as an Orientation Group
Leader (OGL) was very fulfilling as I was able to help the lovely Sec one
juniors experience the TKGS culture within those few days. The experience
taught me how to lead a team and care for both my juniors and my fellow
OGLs. It was heartwarming to see the Secondary Ones opening up and interacting
with their other classmates after the icebreakers and to see the smiles
on their faces after campfire night!’ shares Joycelyn Tan (4H4).</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>Particularly for the Secondary One students, the highlight of their experience
was the electrifying campfire night. Under the starry sky (or the twinkling
lights, thanks to the unexpected rain!), students showcased their talents
with dazzling class performances. The hard work during rehearsals culminated
in a symphony of laughter, music, and shared joy, a true testament to the
teamwork and camaraderie forged during the unforgettable Cohort Experience.</p>

</div>
<p>Innofest, our annual learning festival for staff, was a resounding success!
Themed "Empowering Learners, Every Way 2.0," the event brought our teachers
together to share best practices and discover innovative teaching methods.</p>
<p>Throughout the festival, teachers explored various strategies to make
learning more interactive and engaging for all students. They learned how
to nurture curiosity, encourage critical thinking, and foster a love of
learning in their students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/Inno24_1.png">
</div>
<p>One highlight of Innofest was also the opening of two subject homerooms
by the Mother Tongue Language and Humanities department. These rooms served
as inspiring examples for our teachers, as they got to observe firsthand
how thoughtful spatial design can create a more positive learning experience
for students.</p>
<p>The valuable insights gleaned from the different projects will undoubtedly
benefit all of our students in the years to come.</p>
