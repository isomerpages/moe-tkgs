<h3><strong>TKGS Sparkling Moments</strong></h3>
<p>Introduced in 2019, it has become a tradition for students and staff to
recollect significant moments that touched them in the year. We call it
TKGS Sparkling Moments. It gives students the opportunity to express what
they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates. TKGS Sparkling
Moments could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes.
They are also cherished memories of school events like Leaders Investiture,
and the moment of pride winning a class competition. Or it could be times
when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit
shown during cohort camps, Sports Carnival, the fortnightly TK GLOW! and
TK Spirit Week. More often than not, the Sparkling Moments we love are
the simple, ordinary things we do in our daily interactions that touch
a heart, enlighten the mind and bring laughter to all. What we call - Little
things with huge significance. TKGS Sparkling Moments are about people
and relationships. May you enjoy reading the following Sparkling Moments!</p>
<h3><strong>Celebrating our TKGS Alumni</strong></h3>
<p>From time to time, our school receives news of how our students are doing
in their post-secondary endeavours. It fills us with joy, knowing that
they are doing well beyond the walls of TKGS and that we have played a
part in their scholastic journey.</p>
<p>Please join us in congratulating the following TKGS Alumni on their notable
achievements!</p>

<p>A cherished annual tradition at Tanjong Katong Girls' School, the Class Noticeboard Competition fosters strong sisterhood and colourful class culture. This enriching activity gives our students complete freedom to decorate their class noticeboards as creatively as they wish - the only limit is their imagination. </p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/NOB_1.png">

<p>Students collaborate to design their noticeboards, visually representing their class values. The lower secondary classes even had a chance to design door wraps, and banners to complement their noticeboards.  This creative process strengthened bonds and showcased each class's unique identity.</p>

<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/NOB_2.png">

<p>On the day of the notice board presentations, cheers and applause reverberated throughout the school hall. Proud smiles plastered across each student’s face as they watched their peers explain their class motto and theme on stage. Further adding to the invigorating nature of the Class Noticeboard Competition, some classes ended with a splash, performing their very own class cheer! “Being a presenter was extremely fun and rewarding as it was an opportunity to represent my class,” shares Rachel Chua Rui Xuan (2R1).</p>

<p>Proudly organised by our student leaders from the Class Committee Exco, this event not only brought out our students’ creativity but also fostered teamwork, pride, and a sense of belonging within their classes, setting the tone for the year ahead.</p>

<p>TKGians are certainly artists too - we gave them paintbrushes, and they traced vibrant strokes of innovation to create meaning!</p>

<p>On February 28, students had the opportunity to enjoy fun-filled activities
galore with their classmates during TKGlow. This event was organised by
our very own Student Leaders Network (SLN), where classes got to choose
their preferred activity to explore together with their classmates.</p>
<p>Students’ creativity shone through their DIY crafts, from loom bracelets
of a multitude of colours, to wholesome beaded friendship rings. "I am
grateful for the chance to enjoy learning a new skill with my friends,”
shares Ashlyn Yang (1H4), a sentiment that echoed the unwavering sisterhood
that defines TKGS.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in other classrooms, Number Painting was a canvas for collaborative
creativity, as students poured their hearts into crafting unique masterpieces.
The air crackled with laughter and shared determination, a vibrant testament
to the unbreakable bonds forged between classmates.</p>
<p>On the athletic front, classes also took part in various sports. Despite
the activities’ competitive nature, students unwaveringly supported each
other, cheering their peers' names and sharing high-fives.</p>
<p>Guided by our student leaders, TKGlow was indeed a day of discovery, revealing
hidden interests and building vibrant friendships through shared activities
and laughter.</p>

</div>
<p>This Total Defence Day, themed "Together We Keep Singapore Strong," buzzed
with activity as students and staff immersed themselves in a series of
engaging experiences. A unique start to the day saw the canteen closed,
prompting everyone to share food packs provided by the Singapore Food Agency.
This shared meal fostered camaraderie while illustrating the potential
impact of food disruptions.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/TDD_1.png">
</div>
<p>Another highlight for many was the chance to explore the Singapore Police
Force's Next-Generation Fast Response Car. Students peppered officers with
questions, eager to learn about its high-tech features and vital role in
keeping Singapore safe. Equally valuable were the life-saving skills taught
by NCDCC cadets from Yuan Ching Secondary School and Northlight School.
From confidently operating a fire extinguisher to practicing CPR, students
embraced the training with enthusiasm, preparing themselves to respond
effectively in emergencies.</p>

<p>The commemoration also featured a crucial emergency evacuation exercise
to an external site at Tanjong Katong Primary School. Students and staff
responded swiftly and calmly to the evacuation call, demonstrating the
school's readiness to handle real-world emergencies.</p>
<p>“I found the Total Defence Day celebrations fun and meaningful. I experienced
what it would be like during times of crisis and how to prepare for it,”
Renee Tan (3R1)</p>
<p>Indeed, the day was well spent not only imparting valuable skills but
also deepening our school’s understanding of Total Defence. It served as
a powerful reminder: we all play a critical role in keeping Singapore strong,
together.</p>

<p>A new era of learning has dawned for our Secondary One students! They
took a leap into the future as they unboxed their Personal Learning Devices
(PLDs) – gleaming new iPads! The school hall pulsed with excitement as
they eagerly discovered the potential held within these sleek devices.</p>
<p>Vice-principal, Ms Xu’s presentation of the iPads to the class representatives
marked a pivotal moment, a symbol of the school's commitment to empowering
students with cutting-edge technology.</p>

</div>
<p>“I am very excited to explore the possibilities of using the iPad as opposed
to traditional methods of learning,” shares Megan Tay (1G7).</p>
<p>The buzz of discovery continued as students explored the accessories,
realizing the power they now held in their hands. This wasn't just an unboxing;
it was an unveiling – an unveiling of the incredible learning adventures
that await!</p>

<p>On January 28, 2025, Tanjong Katong Girls’ School came alive with festive
cheer as students celebrated the Year of the Snake with a day brimming
with culture and camaraderie.</p>
<p>Preparations had started weeks earlier, with a spirited classroom decoration
competition with reference to the year of the Snake turning the school
into a vibrant kaleidoscope of red, symbolising prosperity and joy.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/CNY_1.png">
</div>
<p>The celebration began with a delightful class breakfast, where students
bonded over festive treats, laughter, and heartfelt well-wishes. In the
school hall, the concert opened with a live calligraphy demonstration which
I had the pleasure of showcasing, accompanied by the harmonious melodies
of the String Ensemble.</p>
<p>This was closely followed by the lion and dragon dance performances. The
lively and agile movements of the performers symbolised luck and prosperity,
drawing cheers and applause from the crowd.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/CNY_2.png">
</div>
<p>The performances continued to captivate, with the thunderous beats of
the Festive Drums that reverberated throughout the hall, energizing the
audience with their rhythmic precision. Our Dance Club then took to the
stage, delivering a mesmerising performance that blended elegance and power,
leaving the audience in awe of their skill and coordination. The celebration
reached its peak when our teachers and schoolmates delighted us with their
own rendition of several classic Chinese New Year songs.</p>
<p>Our celebration concluded memorably with the gifting of oranges, a symbol
of prosperity and happiness, to our staff, parents, and our invited guests
from Mountbatten.</p>
<p>“It was a day of togetherness, laughter, and cultural appreciation that
would be remembered for years to come.” Emily Prajogo (4R6) shared, capturing
the pride and excitement that filled the air.</p>

</div>
<p>Roars of excitement echoed through the halls of Tanjong Katong Girls'
School as our Secondary One to Four students plunged headfirst into their
Cohort Experience, kickstarting a brand new year. This vibrant celebration
of school spirit wasn't just about fun and games; it was also a testament
to our commitment to nurturing a sisterhood of care and support for our
TKGians.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/CC_1.png">
</div>
<p>From adrenaline-pumping dragon boat races to the serenity of cycling along
the East Coast Park, these various activities provided many opportunities
for our TKGians to connect with their peers and teachers, all while learning
more about the school’s values and culture.</p>
<p>We find out from our student what the experience was like for them:</p>
<p>‘My Orientation Group Leaders were incredible! They were so enthusiastic
and supportive. Singing the school song together created such a strong
sense of belonging. I loved the entire Cohort Experience, especially campfire
night!’ shares Candyse Tay (1R1)</p>
<p>‘I got to know classmates that I previously did not know that well, strengthening
our class spirit as we had fun together,’ shares Aafsheen Ibrahim (2C3)</p>
<p>‘The cohort experience was truly one-of-a-kind! The exciting cycling expedition
pushed me beyond my comfort zone, allowing me to challenge myself and reach
new heights as I embarked on an incredible adventure with my new class,’
reflects Karis Sing (3R6).</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/CC_2.png">
</div>
<p>‘Activities such as dragon boating and bouldering gave me a rare opportunity
to step out of school to spend time having fun with my friends. The ECG
workshops and learning journeys to Lifelong Learning Institute and Ngee
Ann Polytechnic also helped me discover my strengths and interests and
explore post-Secondary options,’ shares Jernice Lee (4I2).</p>
<p>‘Leading the Sec Ones during Cohort experience as an Orientation Group
Leader (OGL) was very fulfilling as I was able to help the lovely Sec one
juniors experience the TKGS culture within those few days. The experience
taught me how to lead a team and care for both my juniors and my fellow
OGLs. It was heartwarming to see the Secondary Ones opening up and interacting
with their other classmates after the icebreakers and to see the smiles
on their faces after campfire night!’ shares Joycelyn Tan (4H4).</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/CC_3.png">
</div>
<p>Particularly for the Secondary One students, the highlight of their experience
was the electrifying campfire night. Under the starry sky (or the twinkling
lights, thanks to the unexpected rain!), students showcased their talents
with dazzling class performances. The hard work during rehearsals culminated
in a symphony of laughter, music, and shared joy, a true testament to the
teamwork and camaraderie forged during the unforgettable Cohort Experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Innofest: Empowering Learners, Every Way</strong></h3>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/Inno24_Hero.png">
</div>
<p>Innofest, our annual learning festival for staff, was a resounding success!
Themed "Empowering Learners, Every Way 2.0," the event brought our teachers
together to share best practices and discover innovative teaching methods.</p>
<p>Throughout the festival, teachers explored various strategies to make
learning more interactive and engaging for all students. They learned how
to nurture curiosity, encourage critical thinking, and foster a love of
learning in their students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2025/Inno24_1.png">
</div>
<p>One highlight of Innofest was also the opening of two subject homerooms
by the Mother Tongue Language and Humanities department. These rooms served
as inspiring examples for our teachers, as they got to observe firsthand
how thoughtful spatial design can create a more positive learning experience
for students.</p>
<p>The valuable insights gleaned from the different projects will undoubtedly
benefit all of our students in the years to come.</p>
