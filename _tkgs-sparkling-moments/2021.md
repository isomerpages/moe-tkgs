<p>The 68th Speech and Prize-Giving Ceremony 2021 was held from 12th to 16th April 2021 in the morning. The school came together to celebrate the success of our students who had achieved excellent performance in academic and non-academic areas. These prize recipients received their prizes from the school leaders in their own classrooms, in the presence of their Form Teachers and classmates who rejoiced with them.</p>
<p>The entire presentation ceremony was screened to the whole school via virtual conferencing through Zoom. The finale for the week-long celebration was held on the 16 April where students cheered on as their teachers and staff members received awards such as the MOE Long Service Awards, TKGS Caring Teacher Award as well as MOE Service Excellence Awards. Our Valedictorian, Miss Nadia Koh presented a warmth and encouraging speech to rally and motivate her juniors. It was indeed a meaningful ceremony that brought the school community together in celebration of the achievement of our students</p>
