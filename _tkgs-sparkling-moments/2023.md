<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isomerpages/moe-tkgs/staging/images/Sparkling_Moment/2023/SYF_Thawdar/mainpic.png"><img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/2023/SYF_Thawdar/mainpic.png"></a>

The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is a series of events organised by MOE for students to showcase their talents, artistic expression and creative voice. The Youth Station Project is a SYF platform that is dedicated to showcasing student’s original creative work in music. Through this platform, student-musicians are provided with opportunities to further develop their interest and skills in songwriting, music arranging, production and performing. 

This year, Thawdar Hnin Htet Kaylen (2E6) represented TKGS with her original song “Letting it Slip”. We are proud to announce that her song was awarded Top 10 song from a total of 49 songs submitted by schools for the lower secondary category. Kaylen presented her song solo at the “Youth Station Live!” SYF Celebration event at the Esplanade Concourse over the Youth Day weekend to screams of delight and support from the public. 

Here is Kaylen live with "Letting It Slip".

<h3><strong>TKGS collaborates with PUB to lead Geylang River Learning Trail in commemoration of Singapore World Water Day 2023</strong></h3>
TKGS is in our third year of championing water education with PUB. Our girls have benefited much in the process, bringing their classroom lessons on Singapore’s Water Story alive.<br>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/pub_top.png">
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/pub_lowermid.png">
Building on and building up this partnership, our girls took a leap of faith to design and conduct a Learning Trail for Kong Hwa School and Geylang Methodist School (Primary) students using Geylang River in our backyard as an outdoor classroom. The Primary School students enjoyed the learning journey and learned about the importance of water sustainability.

We are indeed happy that our girls are living out our school mission to become lifelong learners and good stewards of knowledge in service to the community and country.
