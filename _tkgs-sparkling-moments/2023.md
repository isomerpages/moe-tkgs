Write for Kindness is an annual writing competition organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement. It aims to give teenagers a platform to inculcate the value of kindness in young children through writing books or poems. This year, a team of 6 students from TKGS participated in the competition and came in First in the category of “Story Writing and Illustration Competition”.

This year, Thawdar Hnin Htet Kaylen (2E6) represented TKGS with her original song “Letting it Slip”. We are proud to announce that her song was awarded Top 10 song from a total of 49 songs submitted by schools for the lower secondary category.

<h3><strong>TKGS collaborates with PUB to lead Geylang River Learning Trail in commemoration of Singapore World Water Day 2023</strong></h3>
TKGS is in our third year of championing water education with PUB. Our girls have benefited much in the process, bringing their classroom lessons on Singapore’s Water Story alive.<br>
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/pub_top.png">
<img src="/images/Sparkling_Moment/pub_lowermid.png">
Building on and building up this partnership, our girls took a leap of faith to design and conduct a Learning Trail for Kong Hwa School and Geylang Methodist School (Primary) students using Geylang River in our backyard as an outdoor classroom. The Primary School students enjoyed the learning journey and learned about the importance of water sustainability.

We are indeed happy that our girls are living out our school mission to become lifelong learners and good stewards of knowledge in service to the community and country.
