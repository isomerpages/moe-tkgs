<h3><strong>A Sparkling Moment in the Creative Exploration of Language</strong></h3>
<img style="width: 50%;" src="/images/22c.jpg" />
<p>The Creative Arts Programme is an annual programme that aims to nurture talented young writers in Singapore. It is jointly organised by the Gifted Education Branch, MOE and Yale-NUS College, and the programme offers enrichment in the literary arts, where participants have the opportunity to learn from academics, writers and artists in related fields. Writing workshops are also offered in English and Mother Tongue (CL, ML, TL) to help students discover and hone their individual voice and craft. Secondary 2 and 3 students with a passion for creative exploration of language are invited to participate in this programme each year. This year, after many rounds of selection, TKGS is proud to share that one of our students has been chosen for this prestigious learning opportunity &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>Toh Jia Ying, Zelda</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>3E2</strong>. She shares some thoughts on this valuable learning experience:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CAP seminar was intensive and, at times, tiring but it was overall a very enriching experience. During the seminar, many informative writing workshops and plenary lectures were organised. The writer&rsquo;s circle, for instance, in which everyone shared a poem gave me a chance to hear the insight and perspectives of my fellow aspiring poets. As for my thoughts about being selected for this mentorship programme after all the training, I am thrilled to be able to learn from my mentor, Mr Desmond Kon, and refine my poem writing skills even further. I also feel very grateful to my EL teachers, Ms Song and Ms Cheong, for sharing this great opportunity and supporting me through this journey with their feedback and suggestions on my poetry portfolio. Overall, this CAP experience is something that I would most definitely recommend to anyone interested in creative writing!&rdquo;</p>

<h3><strong>69th Speech & Prize-Giving Ceremony and School Official Opening Ceremony 2022</strong></h3>

<p>The 69th Speech &amp; Prize-Giving Ceremony and School Official Opening Ceremony 2022 was held from 11 to 16 April 2022. This ceremony themed New Hopes, Unbounded marks the beginning of a new chapter in TKGS&rsquo; history. As we move out of the COVID-19 pandemic into the endemic stage, we hope to be COVID-resilient. New Hopes, Unbounded encourages the spirit of positivity, optimism, resilience, abundant courage, and creative thinking amongst the TKGS family. Anchored in service and leadership, TKGS is now at the forefront of designing and enhancing programmes to meet the 21st century needs of the students, leveraging technology and the improved physical facilities of the school to allow learning to take place in the &ldquo;big classroom&rdquo;, beyond the four walls of the classroom. This big classroom concept also extends to the Mountbatten community where TKGians can keep an observant eye to see the needs of others, hold an attentive heart to care about community issues and have the courage to act on social issues. This will enable them to be leaders of character with the impassioned spirit to serve common good and live out the ideals encapsulated in the school song which is to &ldquo;serve in honour and work for selfless fame, for credit of our country and glory of her name.&rdquo; This story of the extraordinary journey of TKGS past and present was celebrated through the official school opening and launch of the TKGS Heritage Gallery on 16 April 2022.</p>
