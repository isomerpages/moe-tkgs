<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We cannot all be heroes and thrill a hemisphere<br></em><em>With some great daring venture, some deed that mocks at fear<br></em><em>But we can fill a lifetime with kindly acts and true<br></em><em>There's always noble service for noble souls to do</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We're not all blessed with beauty nor everyone with brain<br></em><em>But each from every other has something good to gain<br></em><em>So let us make an effort to keep it as a rule<br></em><em>That each one needs the other within the Katong School</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Then let us fill the hours with minutes truly spent<br></em><em>In helping one another towards a true content<br></em><em>So let us serve with honour and work for selfless fame<br></em><em>For credit of our country and glory of her name</em></p>
<p><b>The school song was likely written by our Founding Principal, Mrs Maude Scott.</b></p>
