<p><strong>The TKGian Leadership Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>In our TKGian leadership philosophy, we believe that every TKGian can be nurtured into a leader. Leadership in TKGS is not about position, rank or title. It is a mindset demonstrated through role-modelling our school values (resilience, integrity, compassion, humility, sincerity, respect and gratitude). Leadership begins with &ldquo;self&rdquo;. A TKGian leader shows self-awareness, self-confidence, self-discipline, and cultivates a habit of constant reflection towards self-improvement.</p>
<p>Leadership in TKGS goes beyond self. It also involves exerting a positive influence on others. The true spirit of leadership in TKGS is about leading through service to others in the community. It is best illustrated in the school song as &ldquo;noble service&rdquo; to others and working for &ldquo;selfless fame&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Our leadership philosophy is encapsulated in our TKGian Compass (figure 1). The TKGian Compass serves as the TKGian leader's moral Compass, guiding her thoughts and actions as she embarks on her leadership journey.</p>
<p>A TKGian leader does not wait passively for leadership opportunities to come her way. She seizes opportunities in the 4 pathways of leadership (as shown in the leadership Quest Map in figure 2), namely,</p>

<p>At the end of their leadership journey, all TKGians will reach the Rainbow DOTE (Desired Outcomes of TKGian Education). The Rainbow (figure 3) represents the colourful journey and diverse learning experiences that all TKGians will have. These will culminate in the Desired Outcomes of TKGian Education, or DOTE. At the end of Secondary 4, a TKGian is an accomplished young woman of character and grace who:</p>
