	<p>A heart filled with thankfulness!</p>
	<p>This is how we concluded 2023 and welcome 2024. </p>
	<p>In 2023, we received a very strong affirmation from the students through the Quality of School Experience survey conducted by MOE. Across the key student processes such as Learning and Social Processes, as well as Cognitive and Social Well-being, students responded positively. More specifically, in the areas of Holistic Student Development, Engagement of Learning, Growth Mindset, Teacher-Student Relationship and Peer Relationship, the school has improved compared to 2021 and did better than the national cohort. We are greatly heartened to see a high 91% of students attesting to the sense of belonging to the school.</p>

This, to me, is like a harvest of our fruits of labour over the past 5 years. Here is my year-end reflection which I shared with the staff, as we concluded 2023. 

.<p></p>
<p>This year we have a very encouraging Sec 1 enrolment with 100% of the 2023 Sec 1 cohort choosing TKGS as their top 3 choices. I am especially delighted to share that a good 90.6% of them chose TKGS as 1st choice. Good news indeed! And we are very thankful for each and every girl who has made TKGS her choice school and her second home.</p>
<p> I am proud to present the Year Theme for 2023: </p>

Here, I would like to share the thinking behind the Year Theme so that you may be encouraged by the depth of thought our student leaders put in to conceptualise the&nbsp;Year Theme.

<br><strong><u>Year Theme for 2023</u></strong><br>Emerging from the pandemic has helped us realise how resilient the world around us is. This gives us confidence that with perseverance, we can achieve our dreams regardless of the challenges and struggles we may face. This is represented by the eagle flying over the mountain range. The mountains symbolise the ups and downs that we will all face together in our TKGS journey. Each of us may at times feel like we are in the low valley when we face challenges and struggles. But we shall remember the mountain-top moments too. This is represented by the eagle, a symbol of courage, freedom and hope. Even as the eagle soars through the harshest storms, it remains steadfast in weathering the storm and flies above the mountain peaks, displaying resilience and stamina. Likewise, for TKGians, we can make that climb back up because here in TKGS, we keep it as a rule that each one needs the other and we know we can count on one another to help us press on towards the mountain-top. May we be on eagle’s wings, soaring high to reach our mountain peaks. Just like the sun rays stretching into infinity, let’s believe in our limitless capabilities. Dream big.  As the quote by James Allen goes, “To desire is to dream, but to aspire is to achieve’. So, TKGians, aspire to greater things, Spero Meliora!

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>Ms&nbsp;<u>Chew</u>&nbsp;Ing Lim<br>Principal</p>
