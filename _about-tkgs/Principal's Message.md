<p>As we start a new school year, we enter a new season of learning.</p>
<p>This year Sec 1 cohort is a very special cohort because they are the pioneer batch under the new PSLE posting system. I am delighted to share that TKGS continues to be a choice school as more than 75% of the 2022 cohort chose TKGS as their top 3 options. Good news indeed! And we are very thankful.</p>

<p><strong><u>Year Theme for 2022<br /></u></strong>It is a TKGS tradition to welcome the new school year with a year theme jointly conceptualised by the Prefectorial Board Executive Committee, teachers and the School Principal.</p>
<p>I am proud to present the Year Theme for 2022: New Hopes, Unbounded.</p>
<img style="width: 40%;" src="/images/princ2.png" />
<p>As we move out of the COVID-19 pandemic into the endemic stage, we hope to be COVID-resilient. Courage, nimbleness and positivity are what it takes for us to emerge strong and full of hopes. The COVID pandemic may have altered many things but it has never changed our TKGS Spirit. We want to remember fondly how as a school, we made the best of the new normal and continued to celebrate school events like Chinese New Year, Youth Day, Sports Carnival, Leaders&rsquo; Investiture, Teachers&rsquo; Day and TKGS Spirit Week. We continued to create many collective memories as the TKGS Family.</p>
<p>As we welcome 2022, we want to remain optimistic and hopeful about what the future holds for us, and we will help one another to adapt to the changes, always standing together as one, even if some days feel like they are filled with rain and dread. As the saying goes, &ldquo;After the rain, comes the sunshine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Year Theme thus serves to motivate TKGians to face any circumstances positively and be courageous in chasing their dreams, like the paper plane soaring upwards into the open sky. We not only have new hopes. Our new hopes are unbounded. &ldquo;Unbounded&rsquo; describes a positive feeling that is very great and has no limits. This is represented by the infinity symbol. Three flowers &ndash; daffodil, gladiolus and sunflower &ndash; are chosen. Daffodil, being the earliest spring flower after winter, represents a new beginning while the gladiolus symbolizes strength of character and the sunflower conveys warmth.</p>
<p>So, in 2022, we encourage the TKGians to see the endless possibilities no matter what happens. May we collectively have boundless positivity, limitless resilience and abundant courage in the face of adversity. With the Year Theme &ldquo;New Hopes, Unbounded&rdquo;, our wish is that 2022 will be a year of abundant growth and limitless dreams for the TKGians.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br />Ms&nbsp;<u>Chew</u>&nbsp;Ing Lim<br />Principal</p>
