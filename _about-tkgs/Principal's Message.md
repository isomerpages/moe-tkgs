<p>As we start a new school year, we enter a new season of learning.</p>
<p>This year we have a very encouraging Sec 1 enrolment with 100% of the 2023 Sec 1 cohort choosing TKGS as their top 3 choices. I am especially delighted to share that a good 90.6% of them chose TKGS as 1st choice. Good news indeed! And we are very thankful for each and every girl who has made TKGS her choice school and her second home.</p>

<p>Here, I would like to share the thinking behind the Year Theme so that you may be encouraged by the depth of thought our student leaders put in to conceptualise the&nbsp;Year Theme.</p>

<p><strong><u>Year Theme for 2023<br></u></strong>Emerging from the pandemic has helped us realise how resilient the world around us is. This gives us confidence that with perseverance, we can achieve our dreams regardless of the challenges and struggles we may face. This is represented by the eagle flying over the mountain range. The mountains symbolise the ups and downs that we will all face together in our TKGS journey. Each of us may at times feel like we are in the low valley when we face challenges and struggles. But we shall remember the mountain-top moments too. This is represented by the eagle, a symbol of courage, freedom and hope. Even as the eagle soars through the harshest storms, it remains steadfast in weathering the storm and flies above the mountain peaks, displaying resilience and stamina. Likewise, for TKGians, we can make that climb back up because here in TKGS, we keep it as a rule that each one needs the other and we know we can count on one another to help us press on towards the mountain-top. May we be on eagle’s wings, soaring high to reach our mountain peaks. Just like the sun rays stretching into infinity, let’s believe in our limitless capabilities. Dream big.  As the quote by James Allen goes, “To desire is to dream, but to aspire is to achieve’. So, TKGians, aspire to greater things, Spero Meliora!</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>Ms&nbsp;<u>Chew</u>&nbsp;Ing Lim<br>Principal</p>
