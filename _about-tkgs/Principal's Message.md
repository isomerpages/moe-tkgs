<p>My heart is filled with thankfulness as we closed 2025 with strong affirmation for the purposeful work we have been doing in TKGS.</p>

<p>At the graduation of the Class of 2025, I recollected how the teachers defined this cohort to be warm, earnest, hardworking, and with a good sense of who they were as individuals. It was deeply heartening to see how, after four years, these young ladies have grown to be a living reflection of our school vision: the Gracious Woman, the Inquisitive Learner, and the Servant Leader. This vision, together with our refreshed mission and values, was introduced in 2022 – the very year the Class of 2025 stepped into TKGS as wide-eyed Sec 1s. Four years since the 7 school values were introduced, it was evident that Gratitude as one of our school values has become part of the DNA of a TKGian. As the Principal, I am encouraged by this.</p> 

<p>The work of our hands is further affirmed by the 2025 Quality of School Experience survey conducted by MOE with our Sec 3 cohort. Across the key student processes such as Learning and Social Processes, as well as Cognitive and Social Well-being, student responses were resoundingly positive. More specifically, in the areas of Holistic Student Development, Engagement of Learning, Academic Self-efficacy, Student Recognition, Teacher-Student Relationship and Peer Relationship, the school has improved compared to 2023 and did better than the national cohort. We are greatly heartened to see a high 92% of students attesting to the sense of belonging to the school. </p>

<p>Into 2026, the positive affirmation continues to come as we received a very strong vote of confidence from the Sec 1 students and their parents who just joined the TKGS family. In the 2026 Sec 1 cohort, a huge majority of the PG2 (100%) and PG3 (99.25%) chose TKGS as their top 3 choices. Most heartening is that 86% of the 2026 Sec 1 cohort placed TKGS as their first choice school. The school’s mean AL score remains stable within the range of 11 for PG3 and 22 for PG2. Great news indeed! We are very thankful for each and every girl who has made TKGS her choice school and her second home. </p>

<p>Taken together, these affirmations testify to the strength of the TKGS brand of education, which has endured for 72 years since the school’s founding. At its heart are both the TKGS <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MddTF6kFMZDGSTuwUmab9wNOI7e3m3Z-/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teaching-Learning</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MddTF6kFMZDGSTuwUmab9wNOI7e3m3Z-/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Development</a> Frameworks, which form the bedrock of this educational legacy.</p>

<p>Hearts filled with thankfulness and the sense of fulfilment deep, we are encouraged to stay strongly connected to our calling as educators, purpose-driven and mission-focused. Staying true to our shared belief in the purpose of school, we will continue to foster quality relationships at all levels to create a strong sense of community and make TKGS an inviting place for students and staff. The positive, caring and vibrant school culture is distinctive, well-anchored on values, sisterhood and a big heart to embrace all learners. </p>

<p>With fortified confidence and a deepened sense of calling, we welcome 2026, ready to take TKGS to the next horizon —future-ready, future-strong! </p>

<p>In TKGS, we value student voices and agency. It is therefore a TKGS tradition for the Prefectorial Board EXCO and the School Principal to come together in a unique partnership to co-construct and conceptualise a Year Theme to welcome every new school year. Through this collaborative process, student leaders learn to think deeply about the needs of their peers, the evolving landscape of the world around them, and the kind of culture they wish to nurture in TKGS. By empowering our students to contribute meaningfully, we affirm their capacity to lead, influence, and inspire. The Year Theme not only sets the direction for the school, but also reminds every TKGian that their voice matters, their choices shape our community, and their leadership begins now.</p>

I am proud to present the Year Theme for 2026:

<p>Here, I would like to share the thinking behind the Year Theme so that you may be encouraged by the depth of thought the Prefectorial Board EXCO led by Head Prefect, Ashni D/O Kanagarajan Solagar, put in to conceptualise the Year Theme. </p>

<p><b>Year Theme for 2026: Somnia Alis Volant – Dreams Fly on Wings</b><br>
The 2026 Year Theme captures our collective belief that every TKGian holds the power to dream, to transform, and to rise towards their own future with confidence and hope. Through this year theme, we hope to portray the journey of “dreams and aspirations” in a way that felt alive, meaningful, and true to the spirit of our school. The final design features a rising sun, butterflies, floating lanterns, and blooming dandelions — each chosen thoughtfully to express different parts of a TKGian’s journey.</p>

<p><b>Sunrise</b><br>
The sunrise forms the centrepiece of the Year Theme design. As night ends and a new day arrives, the sun rises, bringing brightness and ushering in new beginnings. Hence the sunrise reflects the idea that regardless of what happened the day before, every day brings fresh new blessings and renewed hope. The rising sun reminds us that no matter the challenges we face, opportunities continue to unfold before us. The rising sun thus symbolises the dawn of possibilities — the perfect backdrop for dreams to grow.</p>

<p><b>Butterflies</b><br>
Surrounding the sun are butterflies, each lifting gently into the sky. Butterflies were chosen because they signify transformation. Just like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, the TKGian grows through a state of continual change - learning, reflecting and persevering through the necessary process of adjusting to uncomfortable change to reach a truly transformative stage. As the butterflies take flight into the bright sky, the TKGians will emerge triumphant, rising with a newfound confidence and strength as we pursue our aspirations. </p>

<p><b>Lanterns</b><br>
In the theme design are also lanterns drifting upward. The lanterns symbolise the releasing of our hopes into the world. In it is the trust that with effort, passion and resilience, the TKGians will rise. It takes courage to dream boldly. There may be unexpected winds that threaten to change our course. But the light from the lanterns directs our paths, encouraging us to let our dreams take flight and stay the course. </p>

<p><b>Dandelions</b><br>
At the base of the theme design is a field of dandelions, many of their seeds already lifted into the air. The seeds travel far, carried by the slightest breeze. Dandelions symbolise the quiet beginnings of big dreams, reminding us that the smallest ideas can grow into something hugely significant and meaningful. Even the gentlest of hopes can take us farther than we imagine if we dare to release them.</p>

<p>In bringing all these elements together — the sunrise, butterflies, lanterns and dandelions, the 2026 Year Theme seeks to convey a powerful message: </p>

<p><i>Each TKGian’s journey is one of dreaming boldly, growing continuously, and rising bravely towards her aspirations. Every TKGian is bright with potential, capable of transformation, and ready to pursue new opportunities with hopeful determination and a courageous heart.</i></p>

<p>So join us as our TKGians let their dreams fly on wings. <b>Somnia Alis Volant!</b></p>

Yours Sincerely, <br>
Ms <u>Chew</u> Ing Lim<br>
