<p><strong><u>Secondary 1 Posting Exercise</u></strong></p>
<p>The annual Secondary 1 Posting Exercise is conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to place Primary 6 students from mainstream primary schools who have sat for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and are eligible for secondary school. The posting results will be released via online, SMS and through the primary school.

Students do not need to report to our school after receiving the Posting Results. Parents/guardian of 2026 Secondary 1 students who are successfully posted to our school will be contacted via Parent Gateway for registration details. For more information, please refer to the MOE website
