<p><strong><u>Secondary 1 Posting Exercise</u></strong></p>
<p>The annual Secondary 1 Posting Exercise is conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to post Primary 6 students from mainstream primary schools who have sat for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and are eligible for secondary school. The exercise takes into consideration the studentsâ€™ PSLE results, choices of schools and availability of vacancies. The posting results will be released on <b>18 December 2024</b> via online, SMS and through the primary school.</p>
<p>Students do not need to report to our school after receiving the S1 Posting Results. Parents/guardian of 2025 Secondary 1 students who are successfully posted to our school will be contacted via Parent Gateway for registration details.
