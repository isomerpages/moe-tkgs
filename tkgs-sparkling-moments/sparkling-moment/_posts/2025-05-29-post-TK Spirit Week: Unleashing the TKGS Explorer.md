<p>TK Spirit Week was a dynamic adventure that propelled our students beyond the typical lessons in school. Our Sec 1 students explored the Arts at a Singapore Symphony Orchestra performance and a theatre staging of their Literature text. They also got to work in groups on an inter-displinary project at Bird Paradise. The Sec 2 cohort turned Nature into their "personal playground" as they explored Flora and Fauna on an Eco-Discovery Hike and went on learning journeys to different industries.</p>
