<p>We are proud to announce that our secondary 3 students, Eleanor Tham Lemon and Goh Li Xin have been awarded the A*STAR Science Award.</p>
<p>The A*STAR Science Award (Upper Secondary) is only open to Singaporean Secondary 3 students who show strong aptitude and interest in science and mathematics to encourage and nurture their potential.</p>
<p>Both Eleanor and Li Xin will be participating in the Research Exposure Programme (REP) during the school holidays, which is jointly organised by A*STAR and Science Centre Singapore. They will also be invited to talks and seminars organised by A*STAR and visiting scientists.</p>
<p>We look forward to the sharing of their learning from these programmes in 2023!</p>
