<p>The Head Prefect campaign was a vibrant event with four outstanding candidates: Chua Xin Yun (3I2), Clesias Yeo (3R6), Charlotte Koh (3I2), and Olivia Lu (3C3) . Each candidate showcased their unique vision and strengths through colourful campaign posters plastered around the school. </p>
<p>During the lunch breaks, the candidates took to the Glow Up! room, where friends introduced them, highlighting their strengths and unique qualities. Each candidate also put up a performance with their friends to engage the student body. </p>

<p>The campaign culminated in a series of speeches where each candidate passionately presented their plans for the school. A Q&amp;A segment followed, putting them to the test with questions from their peers, addressing concerns and ideas for the future of Tanjong Katong Girlsâ€™ School. </p>
