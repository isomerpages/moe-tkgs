<p>Innofest, our annual learning festival for staff, was a resounding success! Themed "Empowering Learners, Every Way 2.0," the event brought our teachers together to share best practices and discover innovative teaching methods.</p>

<p>Throughout the festival, teachers explored various strategies to make learning more interactive and engaging for all students. They learned how to nurture curiosity, encourage critical thinking, and foster a love of learning in their students.</p>

<p>One highlight of Innofest was also the opening of two subject homerooms by the Mother Tongue Language and Humanities department. These rooms served as inspiring examples for our teachers, as they got to observe firsthand how thoughtful spatial design can create a more positive learning experience for students. </p>

<p>The valuable insights gleaned from the different projects will undoubtedly benefit all of our students in the years to come.</p>
