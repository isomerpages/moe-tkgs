<p>Roars of excitement echoed through the halls of Tanjong Katong Girls' School as our Secondary One to Four students plunged headfirst into their Cohort Experience, kickstarting a brand new year. This vibrant celebration of school spirit wasn't just about fun and games; it was also a testament to our commitment to nurturing a sisterhood of care and support for our TKGians.</p>

<p>From adrenaline-pumping dragon boat races to the serenity of cycling along the East Coast Park, these various activities provided many opportunities for our TKGians to connect with their peers and teachers, all while learning more about the school’s values and culture.</p>

<p>We find out from our student what the experience was like for them:</p>

<p>‘My Orientation Group Leaders were incredible! They were so enthusiastic and supportive. Singing the school song together created such a strong sense of belonging. I loved the entire Cohort Experience, especially campfire night!’ shares Candyse Tay (1R1)</p>

<p>‘I got to know classmates that I previously did not know that well, strengthening our class spirit as we had fun together,’ shares Aafsheen Ibrahim (2C3).</p>

<p>‘The cohort experience was truly one-of-a-kind! The exciting cycling expedition pushed me beyond my comfort zone, allowing me to challenge myself and reach new heights as I embarked on an incredible adventure with my new class,’ reflects Karis Sing (3R6).</p>

<p>‘Activities such as dragon boating and bouldering gave me a rare opportunity to step out of school to spend time having fun with my friends. The ECG workshops and learning journeys to Lifelong Learning Institute and Ngee Ann Polytechnic also helped me discover my strengths and interests and explore post-Secondary options,’ shares Jernice Lee (4I2). </p>

<p>‘Leading the Sec Ones during Cohort experience as an Orientation Group Leader (OGL) was very fulfilling as I was able to help the lovely Sec one juniors experience the TKGS culture within those few days. The experience taught me how to lead a team and care for both my juniors and my fellow OGLs. It was heartwarming to see the Secondary Ones opening up and interacting with their other classmates after the icebreakers and to see the smiles on their faces after campfire night!’ shares Joycelyn Tan (4H4). </p>

<p>Particularly for the Secondary One students, the highlight of their experience was the electrifying campfire night. Under the starry sky (or the twinkling lights, thanks to the unexpected rain!), students showcased their talents with dazzling class performances. The hard work during rehearsals culminated in a symphony of laughter, music, and shared joy, a true testament to the teamwork and camaraderie forged during the unforgettable Cohort Experience.</p>
