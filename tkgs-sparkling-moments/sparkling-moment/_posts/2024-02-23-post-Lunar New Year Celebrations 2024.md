<p>TKGS hosted a Chinese New Year celebration to usher in the year of the
Dragon. We invited parents as well as senior residents from Mountbatten
to join in the festivities.</p>
<p>To kick start the celebrations, our students unleashed their creativity
with dragon themed decor for their classrooms. They also put together hampers
for our invited guests. Next, was a reunion class breakfast to enjoy delicious
treats and strengthen bonds with their classmates and teachers.</p>
<p>Following the class activities, we convened in the hall for a concert
brimming with various performances, including calligraphy, martial arts,
acapella by our own students, and a cultural dance performance by the Singapore
Chinese Dance Theatre. An unexpected highlight was the appearance of our
TKGS alumnus - Loh Xuan Yan, Carys of class 2023 who treated us to a medley
of Chinese New Year songs.</p>
<p>The celebration ended on a high note, with the gifting of oranges, representing
prosperity and happiness, to our staff, seniors, and parents. It was an
unforgettable event filled with meaninging conversations and gratitude.</p>
