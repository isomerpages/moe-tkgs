<p>The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is a series of events organised by MOE for students to showcase their talents, artistic expression and creative voice. The Youth Station Live! is a SYF platform that is dedicated to showcasing student’s original creative work in music. Through this platform, student-musicians are provided with opportunities to further develop their interest and skills in songwriting, music arranging, production and performing. After their songs were selected, MOE made possible for the songwriters a fruitful e-mentoring session with a professional songwriter to discuss the merits of their song and how improvements can be made. </p>

<p>This year, TKGS had two songs selected and they were:<br>
“Hero Too” by Thawdar Hnin Htet Kaylen (3C3)  <br>
“Daisy” by Ni Wayan Tara Shakila Binte Andiyanta, Tanya Sandeep Nair and Esther John (2I2)<br></p>
<p>Both songs were presented at the “Youth Station Live!” SYF Celebration event at The Pod (National Library) over the Youth Day weekend to screams of delight and support from school leaders, teachers, parents and friends.</p>
<p>Here is Kaylen performing her song “Hero Too”.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the students and staff who supported and encouraged our singer-songwriters in their journey. Special thanks also goes to Mr Mulyadi for recording both songs for submission and assisting with the soundcheck at The Pod.</p>
