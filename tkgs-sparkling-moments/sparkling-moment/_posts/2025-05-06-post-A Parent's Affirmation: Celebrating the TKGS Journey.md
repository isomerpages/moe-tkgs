We are delighted to share a heartfelt affirmation from Mdm Loong Shih Huey, mother of recent graduate Julia Chia Xiu-en (4R1, 2024). Receiving such encouraging words truly warms our hearts and reinforces the strong partnership we deeply value between home and school. Mdm Loong's kind reflections (appended below) on Julia's positive and enriching experience at TKGS underscore our commitment to fostering a supportive environment where every student can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. Her appreciation for our dedicated teachers, caring staff, engaging activities, and the school's nurturing culture highlights the rich tapestry of experiences we strive to create for each and every TKGS girl.
