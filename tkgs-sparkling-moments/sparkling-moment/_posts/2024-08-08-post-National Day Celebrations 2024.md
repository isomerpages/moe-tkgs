<p>Despite a brief morning shower, the spirits were high at TKGS as we celebrated Singapore's 59th birthday. The festivities kicked off with a rousing National Day Observance Parade and a dazzling display by our Uniformed Groups.
In classrooms across the school, students delved into what made Singapore special. Lower secondary and Sec 4 students reflected on their gratitude, while Sec 3 students explored the significance of citizenship during a heartwarming NRIC Presentation Ceremony.

<p>The National Day concert was a highlight, with the house captains setting the stage for a memorable evening. An external music band treated us to a beautiful rendition of National Day songs, followed by a fascinating sharing session by the Sec 3 CCE Subject about their NE Show experiences. A fun-filled National Day Quiz tested our knowledge of Singapore, and the excitement reached a fever pitch when Xi An Gao Xin High School joined in with a song about chasing dreams. The iconic NDP Mascot, August, also made a special appearance, leading us in a lively Dance of Nation and Sing-along session.</p>
<p>"The best part was the sing-along to nostalgic national day songs," shared Yap Rui Yi, 3C3. "Everyone was so enthusiastic, dancing, singing, and clapping along. It was a truly lively atmosphere."</p>

<p>To make the celebration even more meaningful, seniors from the Mountbatten community were invited to join us. This joint celebration, uniting staff, students, guests from Xi An, and the Mountbatten seniors, perfectly embodied the year's theme, "Together, As One United People." It reminded us of the importance of coming together and playing our part to shape a brighter future for ourselves and those around us.</p>
