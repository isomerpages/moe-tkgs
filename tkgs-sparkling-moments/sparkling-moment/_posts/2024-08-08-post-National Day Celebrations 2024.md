Despite the short downpour in the morning, it did not dampen the joyous atmosphere and excitement at TKGS. The celebrations started with the ceremonial National Day Observance Parade and impressive march in and Fire of Joy by the Uniformed Groups in the school hall.

In their classrooms, lower secondary and Sec 4 students reflected about why they are grateful about Singapore. Meanwhile, the Sec 3 students reflected about the importance of being a citizen in the meaningful NRIC Presentation Ceremony.

During the National Day concert, the house captains livened up the atmosphere. The first item was a beautiful rendition of National Day Songs by an external music band. The Sec 3 CCE Subject shared about the interesting experiences at the NE Show. Students also learned about fun facts about Singapore in the engaging National Day Quiz. To add to the excitement, Xi An Gao Xin School sang a song about pursuing our dreams and NDP Mascot, August, joined in the Dance of Nation and Sing-along session. Seniors from the Mountbatten community were also invited to join the celebrations. The joint celebration of the staff, students, guests from Xi An and the seniors from Mountbatten exemplified this year’s theme of  “Together, As One United People”.  It reminded us about the importance of coming together and playing our part to shape our future and uplifting those around us.

Quotes:
“The best take-away was the sing-along to nostalgic national day songs. I liked how everyone was so participative as many students danced enthusiastically with friends and sang loudly or clapped along. It was a very lively atmosphere. The 'In Harmony' team's music was really good, very energetic yet soothing.” Yap Rui Yi. 3C3
