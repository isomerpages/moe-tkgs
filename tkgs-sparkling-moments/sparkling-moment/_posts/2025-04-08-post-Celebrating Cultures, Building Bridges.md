<p>The air crackled with excitement and the vibrant hues of tradition as our school community came together for a truly unforgettable International Friendship Day (IFD) celebration on 8 April!  Through the morning assembly sharings, students gained a deeper understanding of the experiences and rich culture of their international friends from Vietnam, Indonesia, India and China. </p>
<p>The canteen buzzed with engaging booths where enthusiastic students explored global cultures. They joyfully played traditional games, savored local snacks, donned national costumes, and crafted intricate items. </p>

<p>“It was heartening to see our efforts being appreciated and our culture being embraced by others. I was also able to reconnect with my own cultural roots as I researched on my Indonesian tradition and history,” shares Audrey Lesmana (4S5).  “The experience also helped to broaden my perspective and deepen my appreciation for the cultural diversity in Singapore.”</p>
<p>Indeed our school community fostered a stronger sense of belonging and built vibrant connections across cultures, encouraging openness and celebrating our diverse community.</p>
