<p>The week kicked off with a show of gratitude towards our support staff—our heroes behind the scenes. These dedicated individuals work tirelessly to keep our school running smoothly, and to recognize their invaluable contributions, our student leaders presented them with specially designed tote bags and filled them with thoughtful goodies.</p>
<p>Next,our students ventured out of their classrooms to discover new passions, forge stronger bonds, and connect with the world outside the classroom walls. </p>

<p>Highlighting some of the key programmes, our Secondary One students continued to build on their class spirit with Cohort Games and applied their logical and critical thinking to solving real world problems in the Math Explorer programme. Our Secondary Two students focussed on resilience and teamwork at their Outdoor Adventure camp in Jalan Bhatera. Not to be left out, our Secondary Three students learned more about the people and culture of our neighbourhood in the Heritage Trail and designed and built sandcastles together as a class. </p>

<p>The week rounded off with our class breakfast at the circular block lawn as well as our school’s mass dance. These experiences were certainly vital lessons in critical thinking, creativity and deep connection. What a great way to end 2025!</p>
