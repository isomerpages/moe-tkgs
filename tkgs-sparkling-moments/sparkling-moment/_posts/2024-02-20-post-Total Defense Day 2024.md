Our school participated in Singaporeâ€™s inaugural Total Defence Exercise. TKGS was one of forty schools selected for the Food Resilience Experience. To simulate food disruption, all canteen stalls were closed on Total Defence Day. Students and staff were only able to eat food packs prepared by Singapore Food Agency for lunch. This experience emphasised the importance of food security, being adaptable and resilient.

Besides the Food Resilience Experience, our students and staff also learned more about how we can contribute to the defence of Singapore through various enriching activities. A big thank you to our uniformed groups and the officers from the Singapore Police Force and Civil Defence Force for sharing your insights with us!
