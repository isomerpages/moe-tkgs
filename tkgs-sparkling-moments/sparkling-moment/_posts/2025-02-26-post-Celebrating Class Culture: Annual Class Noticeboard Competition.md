<p>A cherished annual tradition at Tanjong Katong Girls' School, the Class Noticeboard Competition fosters strong sisterhood and vibrant class culture. This enriching activity gives our students complete freedom to decorate their class noticeboards as creatively as they wish - the only limit is their imagination. </p>

<p>Students collaborate to design their noticeboards, with the lower secondary classes also designing door wraps, and banners, visually representing their class values. This creative process strengthened bonds and showcased each class's unique identity.</p>

<p>On the day of the presentations, cheers and applause reverberated throughout the school hall.  Proud smiles plastered across each student’s face as they watched their peers explain their class motto and theme on stage. Further adding to the invigorating nature of the Class Noticeboard Competition, some classes ended with a splash, performing their very own class cheer! “Being a presenter was extremely fun and rewarding as it was an opportunity to represent my class,” shares Rachel Chua Rui Xuan (2R1).</p>

<p>Proudly organised by our student leaders from the Class Committee Exco, this event not only brought out our students’ creativity but also fostered teamwork, pride, and a sense of belonging within their classes, setting the tone for the year ahead. </p>

<p>TKGians are certainly artists too - we gave them paintbrushes, and they traced vibrant strokes of innovation.</p>
