<p>On Saturday, 31 January, Tanjong Katong Girls’ School hosted the Parent–Child Bonding - Responders Plus Programme (RPP), organised by Parentlink in collaboration with Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). Conducted on the TKGS campus, the four-hour programme brought parents and their children together for a meaningful day of hands-on learning centred on emergency preparedness and life-saving skills. Guided by experienced SCDF officers, participants learn about essential emergency preparedness and life-saving skills, including first aid, CPR and AED usage, fire safety, evacuation procedures and SGSecure awareness.</p>

<p>This programme provided a nurturing and supportive environment for TKGians and their families to learn side by side, while contributing to a vibrant and dynamic school life through active participation and realistic simulations. At the same time, it reinforced community- and character-centred values, strengthening family bonds and nurturing a shared sense of responsibility, resilience and care for others within the wider community.</p>
