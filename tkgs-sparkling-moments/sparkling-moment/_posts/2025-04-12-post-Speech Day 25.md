<p>The 72nd Speech &amp; Prize Giving Ceremony was more than a celebration—it was a shining tribute to the courage, determination, and resilience of our students, perfectly capturing the spirit of this year’s theme, Aurora Odyssey – Dawn of a New Adventure.</p>

<p>During the week-long celebration leading up to the main event, various TKGS staff members and Secondary 1 to 3 students received their awards during the morning assembly. The student recipients were proudly joined by their parents in front of the school.</p>

<p>On 12 April, the celebration culminated in a special ceremony that brought the school community together in a spirit of pride and inspiration. Our Guest of Honour, Dr. Shen Yiru, founder and Chief Executive Officer of The Gentle Group, urged our students to embrace the courage to make changes, follow their passion, and remember that grades do not define us. A scientist by training with a distinguished career in the sciences, Dr. Shen made a bold choice in 2019 to leave the stability of her role at A-Star and pursue a greater purpose. Fueled by hope and a deep commitment to improving patients’ lives, she founded Gentle Group, a social enterprise focused on providing pureed meals and specialised care for individuals with swallowing difficulties. Her journey is a powerful reminder of the importance of hope, discovery, and determination, even when faced with the challenges of forging an unconventional path.</p>

<p>In the same spirit, our Valedictorian, Loh Si Ling, spoke passionately about how stepping out of her comfort zone to serve as her class Chairperson opened doors to unexpected opportunities and helped her develop her leadership skills, ultimately leading to her appointment as the school’s Head Prefect.<br>“…the smallest actions can have the biggest impact… when you take risks and embrace challenges, you open the door to growth in ways you never imagined… be bold, and dare start your own adventure.” – Loh Si Ling, Valedictorian of Class 2024.</p>

<p>The 72nd Speech &amp; Prize Giving Ceremony was a testament to the diverse talents and achievements of our students. As they continue their journeys, we have faith that they will carry with them the lessons learned in TKGS, ready to explore new horizons and seize the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
