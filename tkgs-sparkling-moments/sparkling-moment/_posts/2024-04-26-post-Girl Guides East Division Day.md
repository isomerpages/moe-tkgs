<p>On 26 April 2024, TKGS played host to Brownies and Guides from 35 secondary and primary schools in commemoration of the Girl Guides East Division Day (EDD). It was an honour to serve the Girl Guides community in providing a space to promote leadership, service and personal development growth.  This year’s theme was “Our World, Our Thriving Future.”, aiming to empower the girls to become active eco-stewards. Indeed, our brownies and girl guides from the schools in the east showcased a myriad of talents – from sports, dance, recycled fashion design to gadgets-making for the environment.

<p>“I felt a sense of pride when many of my new friends from other schools praised the school environment, especially our verdant greenery. I also enjoyed holding casual conversations with guides from other schools, understanding how guide sessions are held in their school and learning from them. After this EDD experience, I learnt how to convey my thoughts more effectively, how to work with others and accept their views.” says TKGS guide, Alicia Han (3C3) </p>

<p>“My team and I took part in the Semaphore Drill performance and got merit! Although there were little hiccups, we overcame them and left with little regrets. More importantly, I learnt an important lesson from this EDD - to BE PREPARED. We had little time to prepare and practise for EDD, leading to some mistakes in our performance and flag party. However, as a leader, I learnt to apply the 7th Guide Law, to HAVE COURAGE and BE CHEERFUL in all difficulties, and also to influence my own guides and cheer them up. Instead of dwelling over past mistakes, we should take action, be prepared, and improve.” says Changkat Changi Secondary School guide, Grace Chew.</p>
