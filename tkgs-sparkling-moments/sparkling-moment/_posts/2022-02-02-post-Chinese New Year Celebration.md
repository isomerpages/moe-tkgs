<p>Interact Club hosted a bingo game with the elderlies at Thong Teck Home in 4 languages. Both the elderlies and our interactors had lots of fun. It was definitely a heartwarming and memorable virtual ViA experience!</p>

<p>The class activities included the making of the hamper, tying of chinese knots as well as folding origami tigers from red packets! All these items that were made, along with food items such as biscuits, were all wrapped up with the collective effort of each class.&nbsp;</p>
