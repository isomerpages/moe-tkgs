<p>Teachers' Day at TKGS was a whirlwind of excitement and gratitude as students came together to express their deepest appreciation for the tireless dedication of their teachers.

<p>As the day progressed, the festivities continued with a captivating concert in the hall. Teachers, accompanied by their class chairpersons, were greeted with beautifully designed tote bags designed by the Class Committee Exco. The concert that followed after was a showcase of talent, featuring lively games and performances that left everyone entertained and inspired.</p>

<p>“Organising Teacher's Day to express our gratitude to the teachers was an absolute joy for both my board and me. This event was heart-warmingly special to us, and we’d love nothing more than to do it all over again,” says Leo Kit, President, Class Committee Exco.</p>

<p>The afternoon brought a different kind of celebration as our staff gathered at the Amara Hotel for the annual Teachers' Day lunch. The theme, "Old School," transported everyone back in time as some teachers donned their old school uniforms, including our iconic TKGS green pinafores, while others transformed themselves into retro teachers of the past.</p>

<p>From an engaging quiz which challenged staff to discover little-known facts about their coworkers to a lively relay-charades game, the lunch was a time for camaraderie, laughter, and reminiscence.  
As the event drew to a close, the TKGS family gathered for a group photo, symbolizing the unity and camaraderie that defines the school's culture. This Teachers' Day lunch not only honored the dedication of TKGS educators but also reinforced the strong bonds that make our school community so special.</p>
