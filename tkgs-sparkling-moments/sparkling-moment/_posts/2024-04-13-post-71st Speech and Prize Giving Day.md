<p>On 13 April 2024, the school commemorated its 71st Speech and Prize-Giving Day. It was a special occasion that not only celebrated individual excellence in both academic and non-academic areas, but also honoured the school’s collective strength and effort in uplifting our students. </p>

<p>In line with our school theme this year, Luceat Omnibus (‘Courage and Light’) - Shine for All, the ceremony highlighted the importance of pursuing our passions with fortitude and serving others with a heart of humility and gratitude.</p>
<p>Our Guest of Honour, Mr Joseph See from Agape Singapore, delivered an inspiring speech on his journey of leading a purposeful and meaningful life. Titled “From Corporate Ladder to Leading with Purpose”, his speech inspired all with his courage in taking the unbeaten path and conviction in impacting the lives of the less privileged in Singapore. </p>

In the same vein, our Valedictorian, Belinda Koh, spoke about the leap of faith that she took when she was appointed Vice-Head Prefect and the encouragement that she received in school which helped her to overcome her self-doubts.</p>
<p>“Every moment shared with my friends in TKGS serves as a cherished memory. Although fleeting, these moments were rich with laughter, tears, victories, and challenges, reflecting our growth as individuals. Each memory has imprinted itself upon my heart, shaping the person I am today.” – Belinda Koh, Valedictorian of Class 2023. </p>
<p>In a true act of collective support, the event was graced by staff, students, alumni as well as friends of the school. Our Dance, String Ensemble and Choir also put up wonderful performances which added sparks to the memorable and heartwarming occasion. As a meaningful conclusion to the event, student leaders engaged in a conversation with Mr Joseph See at the reception to learn more from his wealth of experience.
