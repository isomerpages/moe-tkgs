<p>From 26 to 30 October 2024, 33 students and 4 teachers embarked on a culturally enriching immersion trip to Vietnam. This journey was filled with unique experiences that deepened students’ understanding of Vietnamese culture and traditions. </p>
<p>In Hanoi, they experienced the renowned Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre, watching a traditional art form that brought Vietnam’s folklore to life. The students also explored the bustling streets of the Old Quarter, gaining insight into local life and history as well as shopped for little souvenirs at the night market.</p>

<p>‘I truly enjoyed the beautiful and therapeutic sunsets after the conical hat-making as it provided a long and relaxing break from the usual hustle and bustle. It also allowed me to appreciate the difference in life between both countries.’ (Akshara Parimi 3S5)</p>

<p>Another highlight was the cruise through the stunning Ha Long Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where students enjoyed a seafood lunch onboard while marveling at the breathtaking landscape. The students also relished an authentic glimpse into Vietnamese daily practices and crafts – through hands-on activities like weaving conical hats, catching fish, and planting rice. </p>

<p>‘Ha Long Bay truly left me with a new appreciation for nature with its numerous unique islands. Being able to apply some of my Geography knowledge during the visit gave me a new perspective on learning and how helpful it is in the real world. I also loved learning about how the caves were formed and seeing it in real life was really incredible.’ (Dayna Shanaia Maha, 3H4)</p>

<p>A particularly memorable part of the trip was the school exchange at Ban Mai School, where our students connected with local students through cultural food and games, fostering international friendships and understanding. This immersion experience not only broadened students’ global perspectives but also strengthened their appreciation for Vietnam’s rich culture, making it a meaningful journey of learning and connection. </p>
