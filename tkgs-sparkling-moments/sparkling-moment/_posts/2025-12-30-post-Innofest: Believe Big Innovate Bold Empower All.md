Innofest: Believe Big Innovate Bold Empower All

InnoFest 2026 was an inspiring day of learning for our staff. Under the theme "Believe Big. Innovate Bold. Empower All," teachers gathered to share creative ways to help our students learn, reinforcing our belief that every student has the potential to succeed.

A highlight was the exchange of ideas on using tech tools like SALiS and SchoolAI to help students become more self-directed. Beyond the screen, innovation was everywhere; teachers showcased students building lung models in Science, conducting Geographical Investigations in urban neighbourhoods, and using gamified activities to master Music theory. 

Each sharing reflected our commitment to believing big in our students' capabilities—seeing beyond surface behaviours to recognise the kinesthetic learner who needs movement, the visual processor who thrives with hands-on models, and the collaborative thinker who excels in group investigations.
