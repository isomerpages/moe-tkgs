<p>This Total Defence Day, themed "Together We Keep Singapore Strong," buzzed with activity as students and staff immersed themselves in a series of engaging experiences. A unique start to the day saw the canteen closed, prompting everyone to share food packs provided by the Singapore Food Agency. This shared meal fostered camaraderie while illustrating the potential impact of food disruptions.</p>

<p>Another highlight for many was the chance to explore the Singapore Police Force's Next-Generation Fast Response Car. Students peppered officers with questions, eager to learn about its high-tech features and vital role in keeping Singapore safe. Equally valuable were the life-saving skills taught by NCDCC cadets from Yuan Ching Secondary School and Northlight School. From confidently operating a fire extinguisher to practicing CPR, students embraced the training with enthusiasm, preparing themselves to respond effectively in emergencies.</p>

<p>The commemoration also featured a crucial emergency evacuation exercise to an external site at Tanjong Katong Primary School. Students and staff responded swiftly and calmly to the evacuation call, demonstrating the school's readiness to handle real-world emergencies. </p>
<p>“I found the Total Defence Day celebrations fun and meaningful. I experienced what it would be like during times of crisis and how to prepare for it,” Renee Tan (3R1)</p>
<p>Indeed, the day was well spent not only imparting valuable skills but also deepening our school’s understanding of Total Defence. It served as a powerful reminder: we all play a critical role in keeping Singapore strong, together.</p>
