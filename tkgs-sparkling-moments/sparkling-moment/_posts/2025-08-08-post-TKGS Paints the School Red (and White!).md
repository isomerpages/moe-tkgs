<p>On August 8, TKGians gathered for the school's annual National Day celebrations, transforming the campus into a sea of vibrant red and white! The day began with a solemn yet spirited parade led by the uniformed groups, followed by the entire school singing the national anthem in one united voice.</p>

<p>It was then time for the cohort-based activities. Excitement buzzed in the classrooms, especially for the Secondary 3s who finally received their long-awaited ICs. “Receiving my IC was a milestone for me. It made me feel one step closer to stepping out into society and develop myself even more as a person,” shared Isabelle Tan (3R1).</p> 

<p>Secondary 2 students tried their hands at making Chinese knots, a traditional craft symbolising unity and good luck, while the Secondary 1s created artworks and videos celebrating Singapore’s multicultural heritage. “I thoroughly enjoyed this activity, as I got to learn more about my classmates’ cultures,” said Cynthia (1S5). Our graduating cohort also put their creativity to the test by creating an artefact that captured their aspirations for Singapore!</p>

<p>To round up the classroom activities, Form Teachers gave out the National Day souvenir which came in the form of a red bucket hat designed by our fellow TKGian, Marisa Leong (2S5), adding to the festive cheer.</p>

<p>The celebrations continued in the school hall in the form of a dazzling concert, featuring musical performances, a trivia quiz, and this year’s National Day song, “Here We Are,” led by the House Leaders. Seniors from the Mountbatten Activity Centre were also invited to join the festivities, singing alongside students. “Seeing students, teachers and our senior guests come together to celebrate the nation’s birthday felt really nice, like we are one big family,” reflected Raeann Loke (3H4)</p>

<p>The celebration was more than just a festive occasion—it was a heartfelt reminder of what it means to be Singaporean. As TKGians stood side by side, united in song, laughter, and shared experiences, the day highlighted not only the pride in our nation’s 60th birthday but also the enduring spirit of unity and resilience that defines the TKGS community.</p>
