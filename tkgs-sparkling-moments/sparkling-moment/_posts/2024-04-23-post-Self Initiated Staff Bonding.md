At TKGS, staff who work hard, play harder! Every odd week Friday morning,  our staff spends time together for a spot of fun and meaningful activities. These activities are initiated and curated by our very own staff!
Whether it is a balmy walk around the local neighbourhood, sweating it out in a chosen sport, or getting our hands dirty with some craft work, such moments are a must-have for staff to take a breather, recharge and connect with one another.
The casual ambience also allows time for relaxed conversations to be had. Indeed through these self-initiated staff bonding activities, we see the warm and congenial spirit in TKGS which allows for a positive workplace culture in our school.
