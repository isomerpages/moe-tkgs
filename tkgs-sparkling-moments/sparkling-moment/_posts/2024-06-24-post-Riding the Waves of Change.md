<p>To celebrate the opening of the Tanjong Katong MRT Station on the Thomson-East Coast line, students from our school, guided by Mdm Kavitha were invited to design a mural to be displayed at the station. </p>

<p>Titled 'Riding the Waves of Change', this artwork portrays Katong’s transformation from a charming Peranakan enclave to a modern urban district, projecting into a dynamic future. Central to this narrative is the now extinct Katong Turtle. It is a symbol of our treasured history and commitment to sustainability as we continue to ride the waves of change. </p>
<p>“In my contribution to the mural, I used watercolour pencils to shade and colour the turtle to make come alive. I also learnt the history of the Tanjong Katong area and how its name came to be.” says student artist Leah Tan (3R1)</p>

<p>On 24 June, we  had the honour of presenting the artwork to Mr. Lim Biow Chuan, Advisor to Mountbatten SMC, celebrating our efforts to bring the arts to our community. 
If you are around the area, do swing by the station to enjoy the mural! </p>
