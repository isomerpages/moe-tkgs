Write for Kindness is an annual writing competition organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement. It aims to give teenagers a platform to inculcate the value of kindness in young children through writing books or poems. This year, a team of 6 students from TKGS participated in the competition and came in First in the category of “Story Writing and Illustration Competition”.
