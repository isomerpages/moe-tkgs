<p>The highly anticipated TKGS Sports Carnival 2024 was held on 28 June at the Temasek Polytechnic Stadium. Held on the Friday before Youth Day, this yearâ€™s celebration was more than just a day of sportsâ€”it was a vibrant celebration of our school spirit and commitment to leading active, healthy lives.</p>

<p>The very first whistle marked the beginning of loud cheers that demonstrated the TKGS school spirit as students from all Houses sprinted onto the track amidst passionate encouragement from their peers. Runners dashed through the 100m, 4x100m, and the ever-exciting 8x50m relay event that was given an extra layer of excitement as our beloved teachers joined the race, making it a truly memorable moment of teamwork and camaraderie.</p><p>

</p><p>For many, our yearly sports carnival is not just just about the racesâ€”it celebrates the incredible sense of community and support.</p>


<p>"The sports carnival this year was extremely fun and eventful, clearly showcasing the TKGS spirit," shares Esther Ebenezer John (2I2). "Seeing the whole school come together in their various Houses to cheer their teammates on encouraged students to put in their best effort to bring glory to their House."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fun didnâ€™t stop on the track! The carnival shifted gears for the Sports and Novelty Games segment, where the action was just as intense. With Inter-House Games happening simultaneously across the field and indoor sports hall, everyone was fully engaged, cheering on their teams and playing their hearts out. The determination to win for their House was visible in every match!</p>

<p>Adding a twist of fun and rivalry, this yearâ€™s carnival featured special staff versus student challenges in Captainâ€™s Ball and Frisbee. Laughter echoed through the stadium as students seized the opportunity to show their teachers whoâ€™s bossâ€”at least for the day!&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To me, what made the sports carnival fun was the events where students could compete with the teachers, especially with the school leaders," says Laurel Siaw Ruo Qi (3C3).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, no TKGS House event is complete without a display of House Spirit! The House Committee led the charge, rallying their members to cheer with all their might. The chants and cheers that filled the stadium werenâ€™t just about winning; they embodied our determination, unity, and pride in everything we do at TKGS.</p>

<p>In the end, it was Teresa House that took home the coveted overall title, but every House left a winner in spirit. A huge thank you to everyone who participated, from the athletes to the organizers, for making the day unforgettable. We canâ€™t wait to see even more thrilling action at next yearâ€™s Sports Carnival!</p>

<p>Letâ€™s keep the spirit alive, TKGS! ðŸŽ‰</p>
