<p>The theme for this year’s International Friendship Day was “Singapore in Asia”. Our school’s celebration took place over several days. We were treated to a medley of ASEAN folks songs during our lunch break, learned fun facts about different cultures and participated in different  hands-on activities. </p>

<p>The Glow Up centre was abuzz with various activities designed by our international students who were excited to share about their culture and lives. Students and staff had opportunities to design Batik bookmarks, make a Krathong (water float), tie a Chinese knot and play Japanese games. They also had fun at the photobooth, getting dressed in international costumes and taking pictures with backdrops of key landmarks in Asia. It was a meaningful time of bonding for our students of different cultures and background to get to know each other better.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the opportunity to share with others about my country Thailand. It was a great experience to host the booth at the Glow Up Centre,” says Nalinrat Deeratanasrikul (4S5).</p>
