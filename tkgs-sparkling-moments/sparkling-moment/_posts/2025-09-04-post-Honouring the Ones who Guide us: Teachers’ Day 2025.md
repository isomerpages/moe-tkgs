<p>September 4th was all about celebrating the incredible dedication, passion, and hard work of our very own TkChers. But our teachers do so much more than just teach! They guide us, inspire our curiosity, and ignite a lifelong love for learning.</p>

<p>What's better than a day dedicated to celebrating our incredible teachers? A Teachers’ Day filled with food, fun, and heartfelt appreciation! The day kicked off with a delightful breakfast where students prepared a simple breakfast of sorts for their form teachers, turning the classroom into a cosy, joyful space. It was the perfect warm-up for the main event—the highly anticipated Teachers’ Day concert!</p>

<p>The energy was absolutely electric as students cheered on their teachers during the walk-in section. The concert stage came alive with a dynamic mix of games, hilarious skits performed by our talented Drama Club members, as well as touching performances, all dedicated to our amazing TkChers. There were also some games that allowed students to see a different side of their teachers. Sophie Teo (2H4) shared, “I learned more about my teachers through the games and videos. Seeing their childhood photos made me realise they were once just like me!” </p>

<p>Post-concert, the day was bursting with genuine gratitude as students lined up excitedly outside the staff room, eager to personally thank their teachers and hand over their thoughtful gifts. Vera Teo (3I2) perfectly summed it up, "Teachers' Day gives us a chance to truly show our appreciation for everything our teachers have done for us."</p>

<p>Next, our TKGS staff gathered at the Concorde Hotel for a sky-high celebration themed “Take Flight - because we lift lives every day.” From the moment teachers “checked in” with their boarding passes, the ballroom buzzed with an airport-terminal atmosphere, complete with travel music plus bustling photo and gift-tag booths. Indeed the “in-flight entertainment” such as Airport Charades, Inflight Snack Dash and Paper Plane Precision filled the room with laughter and friendly rivalry.</p>

<p>This year’s Teachers’ Day festivities from our students, School Advisory Committee, Alumni and Parentlink truly recognised the hard and heart work of our teachers as they help every student take flight. Happy Teachers’ Day!</p>
