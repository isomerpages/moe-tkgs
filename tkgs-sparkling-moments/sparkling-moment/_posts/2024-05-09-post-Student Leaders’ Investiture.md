This was done whilst formally recognizing the contributions and legacy of our Sec 4 Student Leaders. The heads of each board took to the stage to introduce their members, express gratitude to the Sec 4 leaders, and warmly welcome the new Sec 3 leaders.<p></p>

<p>This year, we had the privilege of having Dr Tan Lai Yong to grace the occasion as our guest speaker. Dr Tan captivated the audience with inspiring stories from his life in Yunnan, China, sharing invaluable lessons on resilience, community service and leadership. His words left a profound impact on both the student leaders and the school community.</p>
<p>The ceremony culminated with all leaders taking the Leaders' Creed, pledging their commitment to uphold the values and responsibilities of their roles. It was a moment of pride and promise for the future.</p>
