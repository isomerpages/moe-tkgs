<p>The annual Leaders' Investiture is a cherished event, celebrating the honour bestowed upon our student leaders to lead and serve the school community. During the investiture, we meaningfully invested our Sec 3 Student Leaders into the four leadership boards: Class Committee, CCA Leaders, House Committee, and the Prefectorial Board. This was done whilst formally recognizing the contributions and legacy of our Sec 4 Student Leaders. The heads of each board took to the stage to introduce their members, express gratitude to the Sec 4 leaders, and warmly welcome the new Sec 3 leaders.</p>
<p>This year, we had the privilege of having Dr Tan Lai Yong to grace the occasion as our guest speaker. Dr Tan captivated the audience with inspiring stories from his life in Yunnan, China, sharing invaluable lessons on resilience, community service and leadership. His words left a profound impact on both the student leaders and the school community.</p>
<p>The ceremony culminated with all leaders taking the Leaders' Creed, pledging their commitment to uphold the values and responsibilities of their roles. It was a moment of pride and promise for the future.</p>
