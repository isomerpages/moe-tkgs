<p>We would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to Clarise Chong Lynn Ching, our alumna from the Class of 2019, a proud recipient of the MOE Teaching Scholarship. This achievement is awarded to students with strong passion for education and teaching.</p>
<p>During her time as a student, she was determined and hardworking.

She is generous and reaches out to peers who needed support. She never turns down anyone who is in need of help and aims to make a positive difference in the lives of others.</p>
