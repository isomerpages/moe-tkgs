<p>On January 28, 2025, Tanjong Katong Girls’ School came alive with festive cheer as students celebrated the Year of the Snake with a day brimming with culture and camaraderie.</p>

<p>Preparations had started weeks earlier, with a spirited classroom decoration competition with reference to the year of the Snake turning the school into a vibrant kaleidoscope of red, symbolising prosperity and joy.</p>
<p>The celebration began with a delightful class breakfast, where students bonded over festive treats, laughter, and heartfelt well-wishes. In the school hall, the concert opened with a live calligraphy demonstration which I had the pleasure of showcasing, accompanied by the harmonious melodies of the String Ensemble. </p>
<p>This was closely followed by the lion and dragon dance performances. The lively and agile movements of the performers symbolised luck and prosperity, drawing cheers and applause from the crowd. </p>

<p>The performances continued to captivate, with the thunderous beats of the Festive Drums that reverberated throughout the hall, energizing the audience with their rhythmic precision. Our Dance Club then took to the stage, delivering a mesmerising performance that blended elegance and power, leaving the audience in awe of their skill and coordination. The celebration reached its peak when our teachers and schoolmates delighted us with their own rendition of several classic Chinese New Year songs.</p>

<p>Our celebration concluded memorably with the gifting of oranges, a symbol of prosperity and happiness, to our staff, seniors, parents, and our invited quests from Mountbatten. </p>

<p>“It was a day of togetherness, laughter, and cultural appreciation that would be remembered for years to come.” Emily Prajogo (4R6) shared, capturing the pride and excitement that filled the air.</p>
