On 4 April 2024, our Mums for Life volunteers joined TKGians for the Mums@Glow Up! International Friendship Day celebrations. They made heart-shaped knots with our students which symbolises the love and unity amongst friends and countries. The activity was a meaningful way to have fun, and provide support and encouragement for our students.

“Being a parent volunteer has brought me closer to my daughters, their schoolmates and the school environment,” shares Ms Alaine Poon, parent of Isabella Poon (1R1). “When I see the joy and smiles on their faces, the time and effort we put in is worth it!"
