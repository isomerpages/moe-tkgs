<p>Our students ended the semester on a high with TKGS Spirit Week! A signature programme for our school, our students participated in a myriad of activities, creating shared memories with their cohort and classes, as they took learning beyond the classroom.</p>

<p>This included a visit to the Bird Paradise for the Secondary One students, learning journeys to various institutions as part of the Secondary Two Career Seminar and a Heritage Trail of the TKGS Neighbourhood for the Secondary Three students.</p>

<p>The TKGS Spirit Week was especially memorable for the Secondary Four students. With a focus on self-directed class experiences, C-SPARKS in TKGS allowed the graduating cohort to organise their self-initiated final class activity before graduation. The students had great fun as they came up with creative ideas such as ice-skating lessons at Kallang Ice World and picnics at East Coast Park. </p>

<p>“The high point for me this year was C Sparks where we played at the beach, took photos, sang songs and played volleyball. Everyone was just having fun together,” quipped Nur Erynna Ng (4S5) </p>
