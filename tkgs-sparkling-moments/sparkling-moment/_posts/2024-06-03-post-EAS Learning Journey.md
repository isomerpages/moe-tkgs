<p>The School Administration Team visited the Green Lab Singapore on 3rd June, where we learned about their pioneering efforts in sustainability. We were introduced to Green Lab's mission to become a one-stop provider for sustainable solutions and their latest innovation, the Casaa 180â„¢, a plant-based biodegradable bag. The tour offered us a glimpse into their production line, showcasing how the bags, as well as products such as compostable food-grade containers and even books, were made. The session ended with us making our very own Bioplastic bowl as a souvenir to take home.</p>
