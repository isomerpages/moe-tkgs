<p>5 August 2024 was an exciting day for TKGS, as we welcomed 40 students and eight teachers from Xi-an Gaoxin No. 1 Middle School, China, for a week-long school exchange programme. As part of the exchange programme, the visiting delegation participated in a myriad of activities to create precious memories with their schoolmates and local buddies. </p>

<p>“My Xi-an buddy experience was great! I managed to practice speaking in Chinese as well as interact with students from a different country. I learnt more about their culture and enjoyed the stories they shared,” shares Elena Heng (2H4). </p>

<p>The activities included classroom and CCA experiences with their Sec 2 local buddies and a basketball friendly match. The Chinese students and teachers also took part in the National Day Celebrations and visited the National Gallery Singapore. </p>

<p>“I am extremely grateful to be given the opportunity to represent our school to host the Xi-an students. I realised that although we may come from different countries, we are still similar in so many ways. Our hearts still lie as one, with our similar interests and passions that allow us to connect with one another,” reflects Rochelle Tan (2R1).</p>

<p>Indeed, this intercultural experience provided a valuable opportunity for students from both schools to broaden their perspectives, enhance their social and language skills and develop a deeper respect for cultural differences. </p>
