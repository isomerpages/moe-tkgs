<p>Our TKGS Symphonic Band and String Ensemble came together to perform at our very first combined CCA concert titled Sounds of Iridescence.</p>
<p>Under the baton of Band Conductor, Ms Sia Swee Suan and String Ensemble Conductor, Mr Jersher Loi, both CCAs showcased pieces of different genres, moods and across time periods - much to the delight of our audience members at the SOTA Concert Hall.</p>
<p>The concert provided a myriad of opportunities for our Symphonic Band and String Ensemble CCA members to showcase their skills which they had put in so much effort to hone.</p>
<p>“The most important thing I learnt was that teamwork and hard work makes the dream work. Indeed, as long as we put our heart and soul into perfecting our performance, we would achieve spectacular results” says trumpeter, Genevieve Chua (3H4).</p>

<p>The highlight of the concert was when both CCAs came together at the finale to perform as one orchestra. “It was very eye-opening as we got to experience a whole new set of sounds from instruments some of us had never even seen or heard before.” says viola player, Dayna Maha (3H4). </p>
<p>Certainly, hearing the two CCAs produce an incredibly harmonious and delightful sound made the whole experience even more unique and memorable.</p>

<p>This concert also celebrated our school spirit as our teachers and alumni join the Symphonic Band and String Ensemble to perform on stage.</p>
 <p>"I got a better understanding of the challenges my students faced as I played together with them, as well as the satisfaction of a successful performance with the very students I nurture,” shares Mr Lee Wei Xun. </p>
<p>A special shoutout to our talented teachers: Mrs Cherry Goh, Mrs Serena Chen, Mr Lee Wei Xun and Mr Yang Hsiu Chen who participated in the concert together with our Alumni Trudy Chen and Nellie Teow!</p>
