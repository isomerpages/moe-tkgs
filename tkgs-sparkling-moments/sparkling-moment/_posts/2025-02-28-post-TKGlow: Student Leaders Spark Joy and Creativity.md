<p>On February 28, students had the opportunity to enjoy fun-filled activities galore with their classmates during TKGlow. This event was organised by our very own Student Leaders Network (SLN), where classes got to choose their preferred activity to explore together with their classmates. </p>
<p>Students’ creativity shone through their DIY crafts, from loom bracelets of a multitude of colours, to wholesome beaded friendship rings. “Making cute crafts with friends really brought me back to my primary school days,” shares Myreen Shaista (4I2), a sentiment that echoed the unwavering sisterhood that defines TKGS.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in other classrooms, Number Painting was a canvas for collaborative creativity, as students poured their hearts into crafting unique masterpieces. The air crackled with laughter and shared determination, a vibrant testament to the unbreakable bonds forged between classmates.</p>
<p>On the athletic front, classes also took part in various sports. Despite the activities’ competitive nature, students unwaveringly supported each other, cheering their peers' names and sharing high-fives. 
</p>
<p>Guided by our student leaders, TKGlow was indeed a day of discovery, revealing hidden interests and building vibrant friendships through shared activities and laughter.</p>
