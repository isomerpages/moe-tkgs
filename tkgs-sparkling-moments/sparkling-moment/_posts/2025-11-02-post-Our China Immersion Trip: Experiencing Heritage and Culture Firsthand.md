<p>Following the conclusion of the school year, we embarked on a Cultural Immersion Trip to China, where we explored the distinctive environments and rich heritage of Chongqing and Xi'an.</p>

<p>In Chongqing, we visited the Tian Run Food Industry, where we made soya bean curd from scratch, and the Chongqing Science and Technology Museum, where we engaged in hands-on scientific experiments. We also explored the breathtaking Wulong Karst landscape, marvelling at its natural geological formations.</p>

<p>“What impressed me the most was the scenery and how geographical processes such as the movement of tectonic plates had led to the formation. The different trails were all unique in their own ways, with different names for different bridges, each with their own rich history,” says Esther John (3H4).</p>

<p>Next, we visited Xi'an where we learned about the city's ancient heritage through visits to iconic cultural sites such as the Great Mosque and the world-renowned Terracotta Army. At the Great Mosque, we witnessed the unique blend of Chinese and Islamic architectural styles. The visit to the Terracotta Army also allowed us to gain insights into China's imperial history and the remarkable craftsmanship of ancient Chinese artisans.</p>

<p>“Visiting the Terracotta Army was an eye-opening experience that helped me appreciate the scale and sophistication of ancient Chinese civilization. It taught me not just about ancient China’s prowess but also about the human effort and artistry behind one of history’s most remarkable achievements,” says Tessa Lin (3S5).</p>

<p>One of the most memorable experiences was the school immersion programme at Xi'an Gaoxin No.1 Middle School, where we participated in both academic lessons and co-curricular activities with our Chinese friends. During the Wushu sessions, we learnt traditional martial arts together, sharing laughter over our mistakes while constantly encouraging one another. These meaningful interactions and shared experiences transformed their trip into a truly unforgettable cultural exchange.</p>

<p>“Stepping into a new school culture allowed me to discover how adaptable and open-minded I can be even when placed in an unfamiliar environment. The experience also taught me the importance of cultural sensitivity. It taught me that understanding others begins with listening and observing others with respect,” shares Kayle Lee (3R6).</p>

<p>All in all, the shared experiences in this cultural immersion trip have fostered adaptability, curiosity, and lasting bonds, transforming our educational concepts into unforgettable personal memories.</p>
