<p>We were honoured to have as our Guest-of-Honour, Mrs Jennifer Yeo, Founder and Chairperson of the VIVA Foundation for Children with Cancer. Mrs Yeo delivered an inspiring address, sharing her personal journey and what compelled her to start the VIVA Foundation. Her heartfelt message about hope, love and purpose left a deep impression on our students. It was a truly uplifting event that set a strong tone for purpose-driven leadership and service with love.</p>
<p>This ceremony marked the start of a leadership journey, one built on the foundations of purpose, courage, and selfless service. More than simply a formal appointment, the Investiture was a heartfelt call to action – a powerful affirmation of our unwavering belief that every single student leader possesses the ability to ignite positive change. We trust in their capacity to lead not just with integrity, but with profound empathy and heart.</p>
<p>As Ashni D/O Kanagarajan Solagar, our Head Prefect for 2025/26, shared, “the investiture was such a proud and exciting moment—it really made everything feel real. Standing there with my fellow leaders, I felt honored and ready to take on the responsibility with confidence and heart." Her words truly captured the spirit of this significant occasion.</p>

<p>As these new student leaders take on their new roles, we are reminded that leadership is not about titles, but about the daily choices to uplift others, to persevere in the face of challenges, and to lead by example. Congratulations to our student leaders!</p>
