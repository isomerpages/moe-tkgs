<p>During the June Holidays, we were grateful for the opportunity to participate in the Overseas Batam Trip. We visited the Batam Museum and learned interesting facts about Batam.

Through the enriching industrial visits to the Singapore Consulate-General in Batam, Infinite Studios and Integrated Engineering Group, we broadened our perspectives and learned that Batam is important in the development of Singapore.</p>

<p>The highlight of the trip for me was the interaction with the orphans at Berkat Bengsa. Despite the language barrier, we shared simple English and had fun them through art and craft activities, games,  music and dance and made new friends. We also forged unforgettable memories with our peers at TKGS.

I really admire the teenagers in terms of their mindset towards life. Despite coming from less fortunate backgrounds, they are happy and positive and make the best use of their resources, opportunities and talents. I learnt to step out of my comfort zone during ViA projects. </p>
