<p>To commemorate Singapore World Water Day, my class (2G7) and students from Geylang Methodist School (Primary) worked hand in hand to conceptualise and facilitate a learning trail at Punggol Waterway. The trail was specially prepared for Valour Primary School students so that they could learn more about the water design features in Punggol Waterway through fun and engaging activities.</p>

<p>During the planning phase, we had the privilege of being mentored by seniors from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, as we spent months brainstorming together and designing the learning trail. On 13 March, which was the day of the trail, students from both TKGS and GMS(P) shared enthusiastically about the water cycle and water sustainability with our guests from Valour Primary School. </p>

<p>“Thank you for inviting us to the learning trail. Our students had a great time and learned a lot from the session,” shared Valour Primary School Outdoor Club Teacher, Ms Chua.</p>

<p>I was really pleased by the result of all our hard work. Designing booths outside of curriculum time was difficult but we managed to apply what we learned in Science and Geography in a way that would appeal to younger students. </p>

<p>It was rewarding to see the smiles of the Valour Primary School students. Through raising awareness on water sustainability issues, the class learned that we can make a difference in simple ways.</p>
