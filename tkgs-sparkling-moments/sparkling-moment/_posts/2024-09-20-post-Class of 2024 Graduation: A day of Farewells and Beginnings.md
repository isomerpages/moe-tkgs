<p><b>Maia and Askista (4C3)</b>: We learnt that together, we are capable of so much more than we could ever be on our own. As we move forward from this chapter, we will not forget the lessons we’ve learned from each other. These experiences have shaped who we are, and they’ll continue to guide us as we step into whatever the future holds.</p>

<p><b>Priya and Ann Sze (4H4)</b>: The future is wide open for us, and though we might stumble along the way, we’ll get back up. We’re ready to face whatever comes next, whether it’s O Levels, our further studies, or finally catching up on all the sleep we have missed out on.</p>

<p><b>Sauyma (4G7)</b>: Time flew by during Grad Nite. It was everything I expected the event to be. It will be something I will always remember.</p>

<p><b>Yang He Qing (4S5)</b>: I feel bitter sweet. Farewell well to the familiarity, the comfort and the sense of belonging.</p>

<p><b>Jing Yi (4I2)</b>: I feel a mix of sadness and gratitude. These 4 years flew by really quickly… I’m really grateful for all my friends and teachers that helped me throughout this journey, making my 4 years in TKGS unforgettable.</p>

<p><b>Keecia (4S5)</b>: Graduating from TKGS, I feel a deep pang of longing for very first day I spent in TKGS. Four years passed by so rapidly, that I feel like I teleported from entering my sec 1 class, to the school hall, belting my lungs out to the school song on Grad Nite. So many of my ‘firsts’ happened in, and because of, TKGS. My first leadership role, my first time on a stage podium, my first time performing on stage, and the first experience of sisterhood. TKGS has left me much to thank for, but the most special things that TKGS has gifted me are the friends I deem sisters and pride of calling myself TKGS alumni. Thank you TKGS!</p>
